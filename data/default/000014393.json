	"text": "(a) The Minnesota Job Skills Partnership program is created to act as a catalyst to bring together employers with specific training needs with educational or other nonprofit institutions which can design programs to fill those needs. The partnership shall work closely with employers to prepare, train and place prospective or incumbent workers in identifiable positions as well as assisting educational or other nonprofit institutions in developing training programs that coincide with current and future employer requirements. The partnership shall provide grants to educational or other nonprofit institutions for the purpose of training workers. A participating business must match the grant-in-aid made by the Minnesota Job Skills Partnership. The match may be in the form of funding, equipment, or faculty.\n(b) The partnership program is authorized to use funds to pay for training for individuals who have incomes at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty line. The board may grant funds to eligible recipients to pay for board-certified training. Eligible recipients of grants may include public, private, or nonprofit entities that provide employment services to low-income individuals.",
