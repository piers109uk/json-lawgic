A surviving organization that is a foreign organization and not authorized to transact business in this state appoints the secretary of state as its agent for service of process for the purposes of enforcing a debt, obligation, or other liability under this subdivision. Service on the secretary of state under this subdivision must be made in the same manner and has the same consequences as in section 322C.0116, subdivisions 3 and 4.",
