	"text": "On or before March 1 of each year, the county auditor shall apportion the interest from the county cemetery fund that has been collected by the county treasurer during the year to each cemetery with a permanent fund in the proportion that the amount of the cemetery's permanent fund in the county treasury bears to the county cemetery fund. If the legal existence of a religious incorporation or an association formed under law to maintain a cemetery has ended, the interest due from the fund to the defunct cemetery association or incorporation must be paid to the treasurer of the city or town in which the cemetery is located, to be spent by the municipality for the care, maintenance, or improvement of the cemetery. Funds deposited according to section 306.44 just before the close of the year, on which no interest has been collected, must not be considered as a part of the permanent fund for that apportionment.",
