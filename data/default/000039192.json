	"text": "(a) Tipboard games must be played using only tipboard tickets that are either (1) attached to a placard and arranged in columns or rows, or (2) separate from the placard and contained in a receptacle while the game is in play. The placard serves as the game flare.\n(b) Except for a sports-themed tipboard, the placard must contain a seal or seals that conceal the winning numbers or symbols. When a tipboard ticket is purchased and opened from a game containing more than 100 tickets, each player having a tipboard ticket with one or more predesignated numbers or symbols must sign the placard at the line indicated by the number or symbol on the tipboard ticket.\nWhen the predesignated numbers or symbols have all been purchased, or all of the tipboard tickets for that game have been sold, a seal must be removed to reveal a number or symbol that determines which of the predesignated numbers or symbols is the winning number or symbol. The seal must be opened by an employee or volunteer of the organization, but if there is more than one seal on the placard, the eligible player may select which seal is opened. A tipboard may also contain consolation winners, or winning chances that are determined in whole or in part by the numerical outcome of one or more professional sporting events, that need not be determined by the use of the seal.\nCash or merchandise prizes may be awarded in a tipboard game. All prizes available in each game must be stated on the game flare.\nMS 2002 [Repealed, 2004 c 172 s 12]\nThe board shall adopt rules for tipboard games with multiple seals. The board shall also adopt rules for cumulative or carryover tipboard prizes.",
