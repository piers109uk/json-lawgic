	"text": "The plane coordinate values for a point on the earth's surface, to be used to express the geographic position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of this system, shall consist of two distances, expressed in U.S. Survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the Minnesota Coordinate System of 1927 and expressed in meters and decimals of a meter or U.S. Survey feet and decimals of a foot when using the Minnesota Coordinate System of 1983. One of these distances, to be known as the \"x-coordinate,\" shall give the position in an east-and-west direction; the other, to be known as the \"y-coordinate,\" shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. These coordinates shall be made to depend upon and conform to plane rectangular coordinate values for the monumented horizontal control stations of the North American Horizontal Geodetic Control Network as published by the National Ocean Survey/National Geodetic Survey (NOS/NGS) or its successors and whose plane coordinates have been computed on the systems defined in this chapter. The station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either Minnesota Coordinate System, 1927 or 1983.",
