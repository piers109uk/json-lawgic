	"text": "If the prosecuting attorney intervenes at the outset in an action brought by a person under section 15C.05, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or more than 25 percent of any recovery of the civil penalty and damages or settlement, depending on the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the conduct of the action. If the prosecuting attorney does not intervene in the action at any time, the person is entitled to receive not less than 25 percent or more than 30 percent of any recovery of the civil penalty and damages, or settlement, as the court determines is reasonable. If the prosecuting attorney does not intervene in the action at the outset but subsequently intervenes, the person is entitled to receive not less than 15 percent or more than 30 percent of any recovery of the civil penalty and damages or settlement, as the court determines, depending on the extent to which the person substantially contributed to the prosecution of the action. For recoveries whose distribution is governed by federal code or rule, the basis for calculating the portion of the recovery the person is entitled to receive shall not include amounts reserved for distribution to the federal government or designated in their use by federal code or rule.",
