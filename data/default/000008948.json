	"text": "If the report of the commissioner does not charge a violation of sections 72A.17 to 72A.32, any intervenor in the proceedings may, within 20 days after the service of the report, cause a petition to be filed in the District Court of Ramsey County for a review of that report. Notice of the filing of the intervenor's petition shall be given to the commissioner and to the person upon whom the statement of charges was originally served. The commissioner shall, within 20 days after the service of the notice of filing the petition, file a transcript of the proceedings, including all evidence taken and the report and findings, and the person upon whom the statement of charges was originally served shall have 20 days after the service of notice of filing the petition in which to file an answer. The proceedings before the court shall conform to those provided for by section 72A.25. Upon such a review the court shall have authority to issue appropriate orders and writs in connection therewith, including, if the court finds it is to the interest of the public, orders enjoining and restraining the continuance of any method of competition, act, or practice which it finds, notwithstanding the report of the commissioner, constitutes a violation of sections 72A.17 to 72A.32.",
