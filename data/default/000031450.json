The commissioner on August 1 shall notify the auditor of each affected county of the amount thereof paid on behalf of such county since August 1 of the preceding year, whereupon the county auditor shall levy a tax upon the taxable property in the assessment district or districts wherein such reassessment was made sufficient to pay the same. One-half of such tax shall be levied in the year in which the commissioner so notifies the county auditor and the remaining one-half shall be levied in the following year. The respective counties shall reimburse the state by paying one-half of the tax so assessed on or before July 1 and the remaining one-half on or before December 1 in the year in which the tax is payable, whether or not the tax was collected by the county. The reimbursement shall be credited to the general fund. If any county fails to reimburse the state within the time specified herein, the commissioner is empowered to order withholding of state aids or distributions to such county equal to the amount delinquent.",
