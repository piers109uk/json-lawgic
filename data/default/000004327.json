	"text": "Meat, poultry, poultry food products, and meat food products are an important source of the nation's total supply of food. It is essential in the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that meat, poultry, and meat food products distributed to them are wholesome, unadulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat, poultry, poultry food products, or meat food products injure the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged meat, poultry, poultry food products, and meat food products, and result in losses to livestock producers and processors of meat, poultry, poultry food products, and meat food products and injury to consumers. Unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with wholesome, unadulterated, and properly labeled and packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the general public.\nRegulation by the commissioner and cooperation between this state and the United States under this chapter are appropriate to protect the health and welfare of consumers and accomplish the purposes of this chapter.",
