	"text": "The county may charge a fee to record, file, certify, or provide copies of any instrument, document, or paper that is required by law to be filed or which may be filed in any county office. The county may charge fees for service provided by any county office, official, department, court, or employee. The county board may, after a public hearing, establish the amounts of fees to be charged for the services, unless a statute has specified the amount. There must be a reasonable relation between the fee and the cost of providing the service. A county may also impose a fee or an interest charge on payments of money to the county that are more than 90 days overdue, provided that late property tax payments remain subject only to the penalty and interest provisions of chapters 277 and 279.",
