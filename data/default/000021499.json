	"text": "Whenever the road authorities enter into a contract for the construction or improvement of any road, culvert, or bridge thereon they shall, as a condition of the contract, provide therein that the contractor shall place suitable warning signs at the highways intersecting the road so to be constructed or improved warning the public that the road under construction or improvement is impassable at a designated place or distance from the warning sign. The signs shall be placed at such places as will obviate unnecessary travel by persons not otherwise aware of the impassable condition of the roads. Nothing in the provisions of chapters 160 to 165 shall make any town, county, or the state liable in damages for the failure of the road authorities to provide in any contract for the erection of a warning sign as is herein provided for, or the failure of any contractor to erect same in accordance herewith.\nThe contractor, lead supervisor, or person in charge of work or repairs on any public road shall, when the doing of the work or repairs necessitates the closing of a part of the road to traffic, post signs stating that the road is under repair and describing the direction and distance of the detour necessary to avoid the part of the road being repaired. The signs shall be posted at the intersection of the road under repair with the road to be traveled while detouring and at appropriate intervals along the road.\nThe road authorities may also provide, by contract or otherwise, for the erection of barricades, fences or other obstructions so as to prevent traffic from entering any impassable section of road or a section closed to public travel.",
