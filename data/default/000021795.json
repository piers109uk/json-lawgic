	"text": "Notwithstanding sections 161.23, 161.41, 161.411, 161.43, 161.44, or any other statute, the commissioner of transportation, with the consent of the owner, may transfer, sell, or convey real property including fixtures, and interests in real property including easements, to the owner from whom the property was acquired by the state for trunk highway purposes through a pending eminent domain action. The transfer of title may be by stipulation, partial dismissal, bill of sale, or conveyance. Any resulting change in the state's acquisition must be explained in the final certificate for that action. This provision does not confer on a landowner the right to compel a reconveyance without the consent of the commissioner.",
