The inspections must be conducted as necessary for the commissioner to know the sanitary conditions of the establishments, and to prescribe the rules of sanitation under which the establishments must be maintained. If an establishment has sanitary conditions that allow poultry, poultry food products, meat, or meat food products to become adulterated, the commissioner shall refuse to allow the poultry, poultry food products, meat, or meat food products to be labeled, marked, stamped, or tagged as \"Minnesota Inspected and Passed.\"",
