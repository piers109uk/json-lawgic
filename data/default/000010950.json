All costs and expenses of the proceedings and all damages awarded therein shall be paid by the holder of the lease.\n(b) In any eminent domain proceedings under this section, any value which the land taken may have by reason of its location or availability for the depositing of stripping, tailings or other wastes from general mining operations in its vicinity, or for the erection of buildings or structures thereon in connection with such operations, shall be considered in determining the damages to be awarded the owner of the land.",
