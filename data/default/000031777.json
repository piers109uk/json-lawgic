	"text": "The governor may remove from office any officer charged with duties under sections 272.20 to 272.30 when it is made to appear to the governor by competent evidence that such officer has been guilty of malfeasance or nonfeasance in the performance of official duties; first giving to such officer a copy of the charges, and an opportunity to be heard in defense against them. The governor may suspend any such officer against whom such charges have been preferred pending investigation thereof, when, in the governor's opinion, the public interest may require. The provisions of law applicable to the removal from office of a county auditor in force at the time when such charges are preferred shall apply to and govern removals from office under this section.",
