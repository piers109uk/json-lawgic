Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a corporation may issue rights to purchase or amend the instrument or agreement fixing the terms, provisions, and conditions of the rights to purchase to include terms and conditions that prevent the holder of a specified percentage of the outstanding shares of the corporation, including subsequent transferees of the holder, from exercising those rights to purchase.\nThe instrument evidencing the right to purchase or, if no instrument exists, a written agreement, shall set forth in full, summarize, or incorporate by reference all the terms, provisions, and conditions applicable to the right to purchase.",
