If the parent is a constituent corporation but is not the surviving corporation in the merger, and the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation immediately after the merger differ from the articles of incorporation of the parent immediately prior to the merger in a manner that would entitle a shareholder of the parent to dissenters' rights under section 302A.471, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), if the articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation constituted an amendment to the articles of incorporation of the parent, that shareholder of the parent has dissenters' rights as provided under sections 302A.471 and 302A.473. Except as provided in this subdivision, sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 do not apply to any merger effected under this section.\nA merger among a parent and one or more subsidiaries or among two or more subsidiaries of a parent may be accomplished under sections 302A.611, 302A.613, and 302A.615 instead of this section, in which case this section does not apply.",
