If sums in the debt reserve fund are insufficient to cure any deficiency in the debt service fund established for the bonds, the council must levy a tax on all taxable property in the metropolitan area in the amount needed to liquidate the deficiency. The tax authorized by this section does not affect the amount or rate of taxes that may be levied by the council for other purposes and is not subject to limit as to rate or amount.\nMS 2004 [Repealed, 2005 c 152 art 1 s 43; 1Sp2005 c 1 art 2 s 162]",
