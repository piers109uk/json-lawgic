	"text": "(a) In a civil action involving a motor vehicle accident, it is sufficient for the trier of fact to consider an award of punitive damages if there is evidence that the accident was caused by a driver:\n(1) with an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more;\n(2) who was under the influence of a controlled substance;\n(3) who was under the influence of alcohol and refused to take a test required under section 169A.51 (chemical tests for intoxication); or\n(4) who was under the influence of an intoxicating substance and the person knows or has reason to know that the substance has the capacity to cause impairment.\n(b) A criminal charge or conviction is not a prerequisite to consideration of punitive damages under this section.
