	"text": "The society may issue negotiable bonds in a principal amount that the society determines necessary to provide sufficient money for achieving its purposes, including the payment of interest on bonds of the society, the establishment of reserves to secure its bonds, the payment of fees to a third party providing credit enhancement, and the payment of all other expenditures of the society incident to and necessary or convenient to carry out its corporate purposes and powers. Bonds of the society may be issued as bonds or notes or in any other form authorized by law. The principal amount of bonds issued and outstanding under this section at any time may not exceed $30,000,000, excluding bonds for which refunding bonds or crossover refunding bonds have been issued.\nThe society may issue bonds to refund outstanding bonds of the society, to pay any redemption premiums on those bonds, and to pay interest accrued or to accrue to the redemption date next succeeding the date of delivery of the refunding bonds. The society may apply the proceeds of any refunding bonds to the purchase or payment at maturity of the bonds to be refunded, or to the redemption of outstanding bonds on the redemption date next succeeding the date of delivery of the refunding bonds and may, pending the application, place the proceeds in escrow to be applied to the purchase, retirement, or redemption of the bonds. Pending use, escrowed proceeds may be invested and reinvested in obligations issued or guaranteed by the state or the United States or by any agency or instrumentality of the state or the United States, or in certificates of deposit or time deposits secured in a manner determined by the society, maturing at a time appropriate to assure the prompt payment of the principal and interest and redemption premiums, if any, on the bonds to be refunded. The income realized on any investment may also be applied to the payment of the bonds to be refunded. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the proceeds and any investment income may be returned to the society for use by it in any lawful manner. All refunding bonds issued under this subdivision must be issued and secured in the manner provided by resolution of the society.\nBonds issued under this section must be negotiable investment securities within the meaning and for all purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code, subject only to the provisions of the bonds for registration. The bonds issued must be limited obligations of the society not secured by its full faith and credit and payable solely from specified sources or assets.\nThe bonds of the society must be authorized by a resolution or resolutions adopted by the society. The bonds must bear the date or dates, mature at the time or times, bear interest at a fixed or variable rate, including a rate varying periodically at the time or times and on the terms determined by the society, or any combination of fixed and variable rates, be in the denominations, be in the form, carry the registration privileges, be executed in the manner, be payable in lawful money of the United States, at the place or places within or without the state, and be subject to the terms of redemption or purchase before maturity as the resolutions or certificates provide. If, for any reason existing at the date of issue of the bonds or existing at the date of making or purchasing any loan or securities from the proceeds or after that date, the interest on the bonds is or becomes subject to federal income taxation, this fact does not affect the validity or the provisions made for the security of the bonds. The society may make covenants and take or have taken actions that are in its judgment necessary or desirable to comply with conditions established by federal law or regulations for the exemption of interest on its obligations. The society may refrain from compliance with those conditions if in its judgment this would serve the purposes and policies set forth in this chapter with respect to any particular issue of bonds, unless this would violate covenants made by the society. The maximum maturity of a bond, whether or not issued for the purpose of refunding, must be 30 years from its date. The bonds of the society may be sold at public or private sale, at a price or prices determined by the society; provided that:\n(1) the aggregate price at which an issue of bonds is initially offered by underwriters to investors, as stated in the society's official statement with respect to the offering, must not exceed by more than three percent the aggregate price paid by the underwriters to the society at the time of delivery;\n(2) the commission paid by the society to an underwriter for placing an issue of bonds with investors must not exceed three percent of the aggregate price at which the issue is offered to investors as stated in the society's offering statement; and\n(3) the spread or commission must be an amount determined by the society to be reasonable in light of the risk assumed and the expenses of issuance, if any, required to be paid by the underwriters.\nThe notes and bonds of the society are not subject to sections 16C.03, subdivision 4, and 16C.05.\nThe society may establish reserves, funds, or accounts necessary to carry out the purposes of the society or to comply with any agreement made by or any resolution passed by the society.\nBefore issuing bonds under this section, the society must obtain the approval, in writing, of the commissioner of management and budget.\nMS 2018 [Repealed, 1Sp2019 c 6 art 8 s 10]",
