	"text": "(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b), this section applies to any long-term care policy or certificate issued in this state on or after January 1, 2002, under this chapter or sections 62A.46 to 62A.56.\n(b) For certificates issued on or after July 1, 2001, under a group long-term care insurance policy as defined in section 62S.01, subdivision 15, issued under this chapter, that was in force on July 1, 2001, this section applies on the policy anniversary following June 30, 2002.\nAn insurer shall file a requested premium rate schedule increase, including an exceptional increase, to the commissioner for prior approval at least 60 days prior to the notice to the policyholders and shall include:\n(1) all information required by section 62S.081;\n(2) certification by a qualified actuary that:\n(i) if the requested premium rate schedule increase is implemented and the underlying assumptions, which reflect moderately adverse conditions, are realized, no further premium rate schedule increases are anticipated; and\n(ii) the premium rate filing complies with this section;\n(3) an actuarial memorandum justifying the rate schedule change request that includes:\n(i) lifetime projections of earned premiums and incurred claims based on the filed premium rate schedule increase and the method and assumptions used in determining the projected values, including reflection of any assumptions that deviate from those used for pricing other forms currently available for sale;\n(A) annual values for the five years preceding and the three years following the valuation date must be provided separately;\n(B) the projections must include the development of the lifetime loss ratio, unless the rate increase is an exceptional increase;\n(C) the projections must demonstrate compliance with subdivision 3; and\n(D) for exceptional increases, the projected experience must be limited to the increases in claims expenses attributable to the approved reasons for the exceptional increase and, if the commissioner determines that offsets to higher claim costs may exist, the insurer shall use appropriate net projected experience;\n(ii) disclosure of how reserves have been incorporated in this rate increase whenever the rate increase will trigger contingent benefit upon lapse;\n(iii) disclosure of the analysis performed to determine why a rate adjustment is necessary, which pricing assumptions were not realized and why, and what other actions taken by the company have been relied upon by the actuary;\n(iv) a statement that policy design, underwriting, and claims adjudication practices have been taken into consideration; and\n(v) if it is necessary to maintain consistent premium rates for new certificates and certificates receiving a rate increase, the insurer shall file composite rates reflecting projections of new certificates;\n(4) a statement that renewal premium rate schedules are not greater than new business premium rate schedules except for differences attributable to benefits, unless sufficient justification is provided to the commissioner; and\n(5) sufficient information for review and approval of the premium rate schedule increase by the commissioner.\nAll premium rate schedule increases must be determined according to the following requirements:\n(1) exceptional increases must provide that 70 percent of the present value of projected additional premiums from the exceptional increase will be returned to policyholders in benefits;\n(2) premium rate schedule increases must be calculated so that the sum of the accumulated value of incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, and the present value of future projected incurred claims, without the inclusion of active life reserves, will not be less than the sum of the following:\n(i) the accumulated value of the initial earned premium times 58 percent;\n(ii) 85 percent of the accumulated value of prior premium rate schedule increases on an earned basis;\n(iii) the present value of future projected initial earned premiums times 58 percent; and\n(iv) 85 percent of the present value of future projected premiums not in item (iii) on an earned basis;\n(3) if a policy form has both exceptional and other increases, the values in clause (2), items (ii) and (iv), must also include 70 percent for exceptional rate increase amounts; and\n(4) all present and accumulated values used to determine rate increases must use the maximum valuation interest rate for contract reserves permitted for valuation of whole life insurance policies issued in this state on the same date. The actuary shall disclose as part of the actuarial memorandum the use of any appropriate averages.\nFor each rate increase that is implemented, the insurer shall file for approval by the commissioner updated projections, as described in subdivision 2, clause (3), item (i), annually for the next three years and include a comparison of actual results to projected values. The commissioner may extend the period to greater than three years if actual results are not consistent with projected values from prior projections. For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subdivision 11, the projections required by this subdivision must be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner.\nIf any premium rate in the revised premium rate schedule is greater than 200 percent of the comparable rate in the initial premium schedule, lifetime projections, as described in subdivision 2, clause (3), item (i), must be filed for approval by the commissioner every five years following the end of the required period in subdivision 4. For group insurance policies that meet the conditions in subdivision 11, the projections required by this subdivision must be provided to the policyholder in lieu of filing with the commissioner.\n(a) If the commissioner has determined that the actual experience following a rate increase does not adequately match the projected experience and that the current projections under moderately adverse conditions demonstrate that incurred claims will not exceed proportions of premiums specified in subdivision 3, the commissioner may require the insurer to implement any of the following:\n(1) premium rate schedule adjustments; or\n(2) other measures to reduce the difference between the projected and actual experience.\n(b) In determining whether the actual experience adequately matches the projected experience, consideration must be given to subdivision 2, clause (3), item (v), if applicable.\nIf the majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse, the insurer shall file:\n(1) a plan, subject to commissioner approval, for improved administration or claims processing designed to eliminate the potential for further deterioration of the policy form requiring further premium rate schedule increases, or both, or a demonstration that appropriate administration and claims processing have been implemented or are in effect; otherwise, the commissioner may impose the condition in subdivision 8, paragraph (b); and\n(2) the original anticipated lifetime loss ratio, and the premium rate schedule increase that would have been calculated according to subdivision 3 had the greater of the original anticipated lifetime loss ratio or 58 percent been used in the calculations described in subdivision 3, clause (2), items (i) and (iii).\n(a) For a rate increase filing that meets the following criteria, the commissioner shall review, for all policies included in the filing, the projected lapse rates and past lapse rates during the 12 months following each increase to determine if significant adverse lapsation has occurred or is anticipated:\n(1) the rate increase is not the first rate increase requested for the specific policy form or forms;\n(2) the rate increase is not an exceptional increase; and\n(3) the majority of the policies or certificates to which the increase is applicable are eligible for the contingent benefit upon lapse.\n(b) If significant adverse lapsation has occurred, is anticipated in the filing, or is evidenced in the actual results as presented in the updated projections provided by the insurer following the requested rate increase, the commissioner may determine that a rate spiral exists. Following the determination that a rate spiral exists, the commissioner may require the insurer to offer, without underwriting, to all in-force insureds subject to the rate increase, the option to replace existing coverage with one or more reasonably comparable products being offered by the insurer or its affiliates. The offer must:\n(1) be subject to the approval of the commissioner;\n(2) be based upon actuarially sound principles, but not be based upon attained age; and\n(3) provide that maximum benefits under any new policy accepted by an insured are reduced by comparable benefits already paid under the existing policy.\n(c) The insurer shall maintain the experience of all the replacement insureds separate from the experience of insureds originally issued the policy forms. In the event of a request for a rate increase on the policy form, the rate increase must be limited to the lesser of the maximum rate increase determined based on the combined experience and the maximum rate increase determined based only upon the experience of the insureds originally issued the form plus ten percent.\nIf the commissioner determines that the insurer has exhibited a persistent practice of filing inadequate initial premium rates for long-term care insurance, the commissioner may, in addition to the provisions of subdivision 8, prohibit the insurer from either of the following:\n(1) filing and marketing comparable coverage for a period of up to five years; or\n(2) offering all other similar coverages and limiting marketing of new applications to the products subject to recent premium rate schedule increases.\nSubdivisions 1 to 9 do not apply to policies for which the long-term care benefits provided by the policy are incidental, as defined in section 62S.01, subdivision 17a, if the policy complies with all of the following provisions:\n(1) the interest credited internally to determine cash value accumulations, including long-term care, if any, are guaranteed not to be less than the minimum guaranteed interest rate for cash value accumulations without long-term care set forth in the policy;\n(2) the portion of the policy that provides insurance benefits other than long-term care coverage meets the nonforfeiture requirements as applicable in any of the following:\n(i) for life insurance, section 61A.25;\n(ii) for individual deferred annuities, section 61A.245; and\n(iii) for variable annuities, section 61A.21;\n(3) the policy meets the disclosure requirements of sections 62S.10 and 62S.11 if the policy is governed by chapter 62S and of section 62A.50 if the policy is governed by sections 62A.46 to 62A.56;\n(4) the portion of the policy that provides insurance benefits other than long-term care coverage meets the requirements as applicable in the following:\n(i) policy illustrations to the extent required by state law applicable to life insurance;\n(ii) disclosure requirements in state law applicable to annuities; and\n(iii) disclosure requirements applicable to variable annuities; and\n(5) an actuarial memorandum is filed with the commissioner that includes:\n(i) a description of the basis on which the long-term care rates were determined;\n(ii) a description of the basis for the reserves;\n(iii) a summary of the type of policy, benefits, renewability, general marketing method, and limits on ages of issuance;\n(iv) a description and a table of each actuarial assumption used. For expenses, an insurer must include percent of premium dollars per policy and dollars per unit of benefits, if any;\n(v) a description and a table of the anticipated policy reserves and additional reserves to be held in each future year for active lives;\n(vi) the estimated average annual premium per policy and the average issue age;\n(vii) a statement as to whether underwriting is performed at the time of application. The statement must indicate whether underwriting is used and, if used, the statement shall include a description of the type or types of underwriting used, such as medical underwriting or functional assessment underwriting. Concerning a group policy, the statement must indicate whether the enrollee or any dependent will be underwritten and when underwriting occurs; and\n(viii) a description of the effect of the long-term care policy provision on the required premiums, nonforfeiture values, and reserves on the underlying insurance policy, both for active lives and those in long-term care claim status.\nSubdivisions 6 and 9 do not apply to group long-term care insurance policies as defined in section 62S.01, subdivision 15, where:\n(1) the policies insure 250 or more persons, and the policyholder has 5,000 or more eligible employees of a single employer; or\n(2) the policyholder, and not the certificate holder, pays a material portion of the premium, which is not less than 20 percent of the total premium for the group in the calendar year prior to the year in which a rate increase is filed.",
