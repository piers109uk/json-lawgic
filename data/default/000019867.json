	"text": "Unless it has been designated as a stroke center or stroke hospital pursuant to section 144.493, no hospital shall use the term \"stroke center\" or \"stroke hospital\" in its name or its advertising or shall otherwise indicate it has stroke treatment capabilities.\nA hospital that voluntarily meets the criteria for a comprehensive stroke center, thrombectomy-capable stroke center, primary stroke center, or acute stroke ready hospital may apply to the commissioner for designation, and upon the commissioner's review and approval of the application, shall be designated as a comprehensive stroke center, a thrombectomy-capable stroke center, a primary stroke center, or an acute stroke ready hospital for a three-year period. If a hospital loses its certification as a comprehensive stroke center or primary stroke center from the joint commission or other nationally recognized accreditation entity, or no longer participates in the Minnesota stroke registry program, its Minnesota designation shall be immediately withdrawn. Prior to the expiration of the designation period, a hospital seeking to remain part of the voluntary acute stroke system may reapply to the commissioner for designation.",
