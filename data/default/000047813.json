	"text": "If any sum secured by such lien be not paid within 90 days after it becomes due, the lienholder may sell the property and out of the proceeds of such sale there shall be paid, first, the disbursements aforesaid; second, all charges against the property paid by such person to any other person; and, third, the total indebtedness then secured by the lien. The remainder, if any, shall be paid on demand to the owner or other person entitled thereto. If the property subject to the lien is a motor vehicle registered in this state and subject to a certificate of title, then the lienholder must provide written notice, by certified mail, to all secured creditors listed on the certificate of title 45 days before the lienholder's right to sell the motor vehicle is considered effective. The notice must state the name, address, and telephone number of the lienholder, the amount of money owed, and the rate at which storage charges, if any, are accruing. Costs for certified mail and other reasonable costs related to complying with this notice provision constitute \"lawful charges\" pursuant to section 514.19. Failure to comply with the notice provision in this section renders any lien created by this chapter ineffective against any secured party listed on the certificate of title of the motor vehicle involved.",
