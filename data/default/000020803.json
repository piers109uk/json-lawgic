	"title": "149A.40 RENEWAL OF LICENSE TO PRACTICE MORTUARY SCIENCE.",
	"text": "All licenses to practice mortuary science issued by the commissioner expire on December 31 of the calendar year in which the license is issued and must be renewed to remain valid.\nAny person who held a funeral director only license on July 31, 1957, may renew the license under this section. Individuals practicing under a funeral director only license issued under this subdivision are prohibited from engaging in the practice of embalming a dead human body.\nLicensees who wish to renew their licenses must submit to the commissioner a completed renewal application and the renewal fee no later than December 31 of the year in which the license was issued. A completed renewal application includes:\n(1) a completed renewal application form, as provided by the commissioner; and\n(2) the appropriate renewal licensing fee.\nUpon receipt of the completed renewal application and appropriate fee, the commissioner shall review and verify all information. Upon completion of the verification process and resolution of any deficiencies in the renewal application information, the commissioner shall make a determination, based on all the information available, to reissue or refuse to reissue the license. If the commissioner's determination is to reissue the license, the applicant shall be notified and the license shall issue and remain valid for a period prescribed on the license, but not to exceed one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license. If the commissioner's determination is to refuse to reissue the license, section 149A.09, subdivision 2, applies.\nRenewal applications received after the expiration date of a license shall result in the assessment of a late filing penalty. The late filing penalty must be paid before the reissuance of the license and received by the commissioner no later than 31 calendar days after the expiration date of the license.\nA license to practice mortuary science shall automatically lapse when a completed renewal application and renewal fee are not received by the commissioner within 31 calendar days after the expiration date of a license or a late filing penalty assessed under subdivision 4 is not received by the commissioner within 31 calendar days after the expiration of a license.\nUpon the lapse of a license, the person to whom the license was issued is no longer licensed to practice mortuary science in Minnesota. The commissioner shall issue a cease and desist order to prevent the individual from engaging in the practice of mortuary science in Minnesota and may pursue any additional lawful remedies as justified by the case.\nThe commissioner may restore a lapsed license upon receipt and review of a completed renewal application, renewal fee, and late filing penalty, provided that the receipt is made within one calendar year from the expiration date of the lapsed license and the person has not violated the cease and desist order issued by the commissioner. If a lapsed license is not restored within one calendar year from the expiration date of the lapsed license, the person to whom the lapsed license was issued cannot be relicensed until the requirements in section 149A.20 are met.\n[Repealed, 2013 c 108 art 12 s 109]\nAny change of license information must be reported to the commissioner, on forms provided by the commissioner, no later than 30 calendar days after the change occurs. Failure to report changes is grounds for disciplinary action.\nAll information submitted to the commissioner by an applicant for renewal of licensure to practice mortuary science is classified as licensing data under section 13.41, subdivision 2, with the exception of the name and address of the applicant. Upon reissuance of a license to practice mortuary science, all application information becomes licensing data under section 13.41, subdivision 5.\nThe commissioner shall require 15 continuing education hours for renewal of a license to practice mortuary science. Nine of the hours must be in the following areas: body preparation, care, or handling, 3 CE hours; professional practices, 3 CE hours; and regulation and ethics, 3 CE hours. Continuing education hours shall be reported to the commissioner every other year based on the licensee's license number. Licensees whose license ends in an odd number must report CE hours at renewal time every odd year. If a licensee's license ends in an even number, the licensee must report the licensee's CE hours at renewal time every even year.",
