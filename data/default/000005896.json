	"text": "At any time funds are on hand for the purpose, the association shall have the right to redeem by lot or otherwise, as the board of directors may determine, all or any part of any of its savings accounts on an earnings date by giving 30 days' notice by certified mail addressed to each affected account holder at the last address of the account holder as recorded on the books of the association. No association shall redeem any of its savings accounts when the association is in an impaired condition or when it has applications for withdrawal which have been on file more than 30 days and have not been reached for payment. The redemption price of savings accounts redeemed shall be full value of the account redeemed, as determined by the board of directors, but in no event shall the redemption price be less than the withdrawal value. If the aforesaid notice of redemption shall have been duly given, and if on or before the redemption date the funds necessary for such redemption shall have been set aside so as to be and continue to be available therefor, earnings upon the accounts called for redemption shall cease to accrue from and after the earnings date specified as the redemption date, and all rights with respect to such accounts shall forthwith, after such redemption date, terminate, except only any right of the account holder of record to receive the redemption price without interest.",
