The identities of the parties are not required to be preprinted on the service contract and may be added to the service contract at the time of sale.\nService contracts must state the total purchase price and the terms under which the service contract is sold. The purchase price is not required to be preprinted on the service contract and may be negotiated at the time of sale with the service contract holder.\nService contracts must state the existence of any deductible amount, if applicable.\nNo particular causes of loss or property are required to be covered, but service contracts must specify the merchandise and services to be provided and, with equal prominence, any limitations, exceptions, or exclusions including, but not limited to, any damage or breakdown not covered by the service contract.

Five days' notice is required if the reason for cancellation is nonpayment of the provider fee, a material misrepresentation by the service contract holder to the provider, or a substantial breach of duties by the service contract holder relating to the covered product or its use. The notice must state the effective date of the cancellation and the reason for the cancellation.\nService contracts must set forth all of the obligations and duties of the service contract holder, such as the duty to protect against any further damage and any requirement to follow the owner's manual.\nService contracts may exclude coverage for consequential damages or preexisting conditions.
