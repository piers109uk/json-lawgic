	"text": "A landlord may not require a tenant to renew a lease sooner than six months prior to the expiration of the current lease, if the lease is for a period of time longer than ten months. Nothing prevents a landlord from waiting until closer to the expiration of a lease to ask a tenant to renew the lease. Any provision, whether oral or written, of any lease or other agreement whereby any provision of this section is waived by a tenant is contrary to public policy and void.",
