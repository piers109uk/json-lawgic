The offer must be at the original price determined by the condemnation process or the current fair market value of the property, whichever is lower, except to the extent that a different value is required for a property interest obtained with federal highway funding under United States Code, title 23, or transit funding under United States Code, title 49. Before offering surplus property to local governments or for public sale under section 16B.282 or 94.10, the commissioner of administration or natural resources must offer to sell the property to the former owner as provided in this section.\n(b) If the former owner cannot be located after a due and diligent search or declines to repurchase the property, the attorney for the condemning authority shall prepare a certificate attesting to the same and record the certificate in the office of the county recorder or county registrar of titles, as appropriate, to evidence the termination of the right of first refusal. A recorded certificate to that effect is prima facie evidence that the right of first refusal has terminated.",
