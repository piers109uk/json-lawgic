An affidavit by the sheriff or a deputy sheriff of the county in which the premises are located, or of a building inspector, zoning administrator, housing official, or other municipal or county official having jurisdiction over the premises, stating that the premises are not actually lawfully occupied and further setting forth any of the following supporting facts, is prima facie evidence of abandonment:\n(1) windows or entrances to the premises are boarded up or closed off, or multiple window panes are broken and unrepaired;\n(2) doors to the premises are smashed through, broken off, unhinged, or continuously unlocked;\n(3) gas, electric, or water service to the premises has been terminated;\n(4) rubbish, trash, or debris has accumulated on the premises;\n(5) the police or sheriff's office has received at least two reports of trespassers on the premises, or of vandalism or other illegal acts being committed on the premises; or\n(6) the premises are deteriorating and are either below or are in imminent danger of falling below minimum community standards for public safety and sanitation.\nThe court may consider an affidavit from any other person having personal knowledge, which states facts supporting any other allegations in the complaint. Written statements of the owner, the owner's personal representatives or assigns, including documents of conveyance, which indicate a clear intent to abandon the premises, are conclusive evidence of abandonment. In the absence of affidavits or written statements, or if rebuttal evidence is offered by the defendant or a party lawfully claiming an interest through the defendant, the court may consider any competent evidence, including oral testimony, concerning any allegations in the complaint. An order entered under this section must contain specific findings of abandonment and must contain a legal description of the premises.\nWithin ten days after the order is entered, a certified copy of the order must be filed by the moving party with the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles and with the auditor for the county in which the premises are located. Failure to file the order within ten days shall not invalidate the proceedings.\nIf the property is not redeemed within five weeks of the date of entry of the order the county auditor, without further notice, shall execute a certificate as provided for in section 281.23, subdivision 9.\nThis section applies regardless of the subject property's homestead tax status at the time of sale.\nMS 2012 [Repealed, 2014 c 308 art 9 s 94]",
