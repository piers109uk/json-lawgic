	"text": "The public safety officer's benefit account is created in the state treasury. Money in the account consists of money transferred and appropriated to that account. Money in the account that is not expended in the fiscal year in which it is transferred or appropriated does not revert to the general fund until claims for reimbursement under section 299A.465 that are submitted in that fiscal year are either paid or denied.\nThe commissioner of public safety must annually report, no later than 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees with jurisdiction over public safety and pensions regarding the financial status of the public safety officer's benefit account; the reimbursements paid by the commissioner during the preceding fiscal year under sections 299A.465, 352B.102, and 353.032; and payments, if any, made during the preceding fiscal year under sections 352B.103 and 353.033. If the commissioner anticipates, based on historical averages, that the public safety officer's benefit account will not have enough money to fund all reimbursements the commissioner reasonably anticipates will be requested under sections 299A.465, 352B.102, and 353.032 and payments for which invoices will be received under sections 352B.103 and 353.033 for the current and next fiscal year, the commissioner must include in the report the amounts the commissioner believes are necessary to fund the anticipated reimbursements and payments.",
