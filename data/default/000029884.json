	"text": "If a county contract or certification is required to enroll as an authorized provider of mental health services under medical assistance, and if a county refuses to grant the necessary contract or certification, the provider may appeal the county decision to the commissioner. A recipient may initiate an appeal on behalf of a provider who has been denied certification. The commissioner shall determine whether the provider meets applicable standards under state laws and rules based on an independent review of the facts, including comments from the county review. If the commissioner finds that the provider meets the applicable standards, the commissioner shall enroll the provider as an authorized provider. The commissioner shall develop procedures for providers and recipients to appeal a county decision to refuse to enroll a provider. After the commissioner makes a decision regarding an appeal, the county, provider, or recipient may request that the commissioner reconsider the commissioner's initial decision. The commissioner's reconsideration decision is final and not subject to further appeal.",
