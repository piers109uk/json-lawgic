	"text": "An insurer may itself establish rates and supplementary rate information for any or all kinds or lines of insurance or subdivisions thereof or classes of risks or combinations thereof, based on its own experience, modified by other relevant experience to achieve credibility, or it may use rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a rate service organization, with average expense factors determined by the rate service organization or with such modification for its own expense and loss experience as the credibility of that experience allows.\nAn insurer may discharge its obligation under section 70A.06 by giving notice to the commissioner that it uses rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a designated rate service organization, with such information about any modifications thereof as are necessary fully to inform the commissioner. The insurer's rates and supplementary rate information shall be those filed from time to time by the rate service organization, including any amendments thereto as filed, subject, however, to any modifications filed by the insurer, until the insurer gives notice to the commissioner changing or terminating the designation.\nThe commissioner may restrict approval on claims-made policies to forms filed by a rate service organization which have been approved.",
