	"text": "The legislature finds that the property tax system would be enhanced by requiring that every senior appraiser in the Property Tax Division of the department obtain senior accreditation from the State Board of Assessors. Every senior appraiser, including the department's regional representatives, and every county assessor within two years of the first appointment under section 273.061, must obtain senior accreditation from the State Board of Assessors. The board shall provide the necessary courses or training. If a department senior appraiser or regional representative fails to obtain or maintain senior accreditation, the failure shall be grounds for dismissal, disciplinary action, or corrective action. Except as provided in section 273.061, subdivision 2, paragraph (c), the commissioner must not approve the appointment of a county assessor who is not senior accredited by the State Board of Assessors. No employee hired by the commissioner as a senior appraiser or regional representative shall attain permanent status until the employee obtains senior accreditation.",
