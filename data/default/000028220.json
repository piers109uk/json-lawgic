	"text": "When amending rules governing facilities serving emotionally disturbed children that are licensed under section 245A.09 and Minnesota Rules, parts 2960.0510 to 2960.0530 and 2960.0580 to 2960.0700, the commissioner of human services shall include provisions governing the use of restrictive techniques and procedures. No provision of these rules may encourage or require the use of restrictive techniques and procedures. The rules must prohibit: (1) the application of certain restrictive techniques or procedures in facilities, except as authorized in the child's case plan and monitored by the county caseworker responsible for the child; (2) the use of restrictive techniques or procedures that restrict the clients' normal access to nutritious diet, drinking water, adequate ventilation, necessary medical care, ordinary hygiene facilities, normal sleeping conditions, and necessary clothing; and (3) the use of corporal punishment. The rule may specify other restrictive techniques and procedures and the specific conditions under which permitted techniques and procedures are to be carried out.",
