Lesser relief may be ordered if it would be appropriate under the facts and circumstances of the case.\nIf the court finds that a party to a proceeding brought under this section has acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or otherwise not in good faith, it may award reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees and disbursements, to any of the other parties.\nProceedings under this section must be brought in a court within the county in which the registered office of the corporation is located. It is not necessary to make members parties to the action or proceeding unless relief is sought against them personally.",
