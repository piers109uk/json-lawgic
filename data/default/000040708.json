	"text": "If a court finds that a town's officers ordered work done on a private road believing that the road was public, the damage caused and necessary expenses and costs incurred in the suit are a claim against the town. Before the claim becomes a charge to be paid by the town, payment must be authorized by vote of a majority of electors present at a town meeting. First, there must be due notice that the question will be considered and voted on at the meeting.",
