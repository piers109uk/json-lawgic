	"text": "A city may by resolution designate targeted neighborhoods within its borders after adopting detailed findings that the neighborhoods meet the eligibility requirements in subdivision 2 or 3.\nAn area within a city is eligible for designation as a targeted neighborhood if the area meets at least two of the following criteria:\n(1) the area had an unemployment rate that was twice the unemployment rate for the Minneapolis and St. Paul standard metropolitan statistical area as determined by the 1980 federal census;\n(2) the median household income in the area was no more than half the median household income for the Minneapolis and St. Paul standard metropolitan statistical area as determined by the 1980 federal census; or\n(3) the area is characterized by residential dwelling units in need of substantial rehabilitation. An area qualifies under this clause if 25 percent or more of the residential dwelling units are in substandard condition as determined by the city or 70 percent or more of the residential dwelling units were built before 1940 as determined by the 1980 federal census.\n(a) The city may add to the area designated as a targeted neighborhood under subdivision 2 a contiguous area of one-half mile in all directions from the designated targeted neighborhood.\n(b) Assisted housing is also considered a targeted neighborhood.\n(c) A neighborhood that is partially targeted may be considered wholly targeted.",
