The inventory must contain the information that the commissioner requests and must be certified by an officer of the corporation.\nUpon audit, if a distributor's return reflects an overage resulting from an inventory counting error, the overage shall be offset against a shortage, if any, in the month immediately preceding the month of the overage. If any overage remains after that offset, the remainder may only be offset against a shortage, if any, in the month immediately following the month of the overage. If the commissioner determines that the overage is attributable to a mistake by the distributor other than an inventory counting error, the commissioner may permit the overage to be offset against a shortage in any month or months during the 12-month period immediately following the month when the overage was discovered upon audit.",
