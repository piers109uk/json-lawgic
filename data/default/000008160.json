	"text": "The owner of a benefit contract may at all times change the beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with the laws or rules of the society unless the owner waives this right by specifically requesting in writing that the beneficiary designation be irrevocable. A society may, through its laws or rules, limit the scope of beneficiary designations and shall provide that no revocable beneficiary shall have or obtain any vested interest in the proceeds of any certificate until the certificate has become due and payable in conformity with the provisions of the benefit contract.\nThe member may at any time, by written instrument, authorize the society to provide and pay for the support, care, medical and surgical treatment, and funeral of a member and deduct the amount so paid, with legal interest, from the net reserve to the credit of the member's certificate or from the amount otherwise payable under the certificate to the beneficiary, or the member may, at any time, designate the society as beneficiary and, in such case, the society shall use this reserve or amount to the extent necessary for the purpose aforesaid.\nIf, at the death of any person insured under a benefit contract, there is no lawful beneficiary to whom the proceeds shall be payable, the amount of the benefit, except to the extent that funeral benefits may be paid, shall be payable to the personal representative of the deceased insured, provided that if the owner of the certificate is other than the insured, the proceeds shall be payable to the owner.",
