	"text": "(a) Except for those uses, developments, and structures in existence or for which approval has been granted by October 1, 2005, or as provided in paragraph (b), no change in use, new development, or construction of a structure shall be approved for any portion of property within 750 feet of the perimeter property line of an outdoor shooting range if the change in use, development, or construction would cause an outdoor shooting range in compliance with this chapter to become out of compliance.\n(b) A change in use, new development, or construction of a structure subject to this section may be approved if the person seeking the approval or, at the discretion of the governing body, the approving authority agrees to provide any mitigation required to keep the range in compliance with this chapter. The person requesting an approval subject to this section is responsible for providing documentation if no mitigation is required under this section. Failure to provide the documentation or any mitigation required under this section exempts the range from being found out of compliance with the shooting range performance and noise standards of this chapter with regard to the property responsible for the mitigation if the failure to provide the documentation or required mitigation is the sole basis for the range being out of compliance with the shooting range performance standards. Any action brought by the owner of the property against the range is subject to section 87A.06. With the permission of the range operator, any mitigation required under this section may be provided on the range property.",
