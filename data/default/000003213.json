	"text": "Any agency action which the agency determines will adversely affect ten acres or more of agricultural land shall be referred to the commissioner to be reviewed and acted upon as provided in section 17.84. No agency shall take any action which adversely affects ten acres or more of agricultural land without first attempting to find alternative methods or locations for the action or otherwise attempting to reduce the adverse affects. If, after evaluating the alternatives, the agency determines that the benefit to the state from preserving the agricultural use of the land is less than the cost of implementing an alternative action, the agency shall inform the commissioner of that determination in writing.\nAn agency action is not subject to review under this section or section 17.84 if the action is reviewed as required by chapter 116D and the environmental review rules adopted under that chapter, or if a political subdivision is required by law to review and approve the action.",
