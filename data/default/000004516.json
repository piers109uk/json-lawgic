	"text": "(a) No milk producer may sell or distribute milk from a dairy farm as Grade A milk without a valid Grade A dairy farm permit issued by the commissioner.\n(b) A dairy farmer who wishes to be permitted to produce Grade A milk may not be denied the Grade A permit solely because of provisions in rules adopted by the commissioner requiring a minimum distance between a water well and dairy farm. To be eligible for a Grade A permit, the following conditions must be met:\n(1) the water well must have been in place prior to January 1, 1974;\n(2) the water well must comply with all other rules applicable to the well, other than the distance requirement; and\n(3) water from the well must be tested at least once every 12 months. More frequent testing may be required in compliance with guidelines established by the commissioner if water test results fail to meet water quality requirements.",
