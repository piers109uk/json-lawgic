	"text": "Special taxing districts as defined in section 275.066 organized on or before July 1 in the current calendar year, and special taxing districts organized in a prior year that have not previously certified a levy to the county auditor, are allowed to certify a levy to the county auditor in the current year for property taxes or special assessments to be payable in the following calendar year to the extent that the special taxing district is authorized by statute or special act to levy taxes or special assessments, but only if the county auditor receives written notice from the district on or before July 1 of the current year that the district may be certifying a levy in the current year, and the notice includes a complete list or other description of the tax parcels in the district and a map showing the boundaries of the district. Special taxing districts organized after July 1 in a calendar year may not certify a levy of property taxes or special assessments to the county auditor under the powers granted to them by statute or special act and subject to the requirements of this section until the following calendar year. All special taxing districts must notify the county auditor by July 1 in order for its boundaries for the levy to be certified that year to be different than its boundaries for levies certified in prior years, and the notice must include a complete list or other description of the tax parcels within the new boundaries and a map showing the new boundaries of the district.",
