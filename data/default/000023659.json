	"text": "Where there has been a default of more than 30 days in the payment of compensation due under an award, the employee, or the employee's dependent, or other person entitled to the payment of money under the award, may apply to the judge of any district court for the entry of judgment upon the award.\nThe application shall be made by filing a certified copy of the award with the court administrator and by serving a ten days' notice upon adverse parties. Service of the notice shall be made in the manner provided by court rule for service of summons in district court.\nThe court administrator shall charge $5 for the entire service the court administrator performs under this section.\nWhen a judge hears the application for judgment upon the award, the judge has authority to determine only the facts of the award and the regularity of the proceedings upon which the award is based. The judge shall enter judgment accordingly.\nJudgment shall not be entered upon an award while an appeal is pending.\nThe judgment of the district court entered upon an award has the same force and effect, and may be vacated, set aside, or satisfied as may other judgments of the district court.",
