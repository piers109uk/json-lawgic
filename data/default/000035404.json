	"text": "(a) A foreign limited partnership may choose to adopt an alternate name even if its name complies with section 321.0108. A foreign limited partnership whose name does not comply with section 321.0108 may not obtain a certificate of authority until it adopts, for the purpose of transacting business in this state, an alternate name that complies with section 321.0108. A foreign limited partnership that adopts an alternate name under this subsection and then obtains a certificate of authority with the name need not comply with sections 333.01 to 333.06. After obtaining a certificate of authority with an alternate name, a foreign limited partnership shall transact business in this state under the name unless the foreign limited partnership is authorized under sections 333.01 to 333.06 to transact business in this state under another name.\n(b) If a foreign limited partnership authorized to transact business in this state changes its name to one that does not comply with section 321.0108, it may not thereafter transact business in this state until it complies with subsection (a) and obtains an amended certificate of authority.",
