	"text": "MS 2012 [Repealed, 2013 c 116 art 1 s 59]\nThe amounts necessary to pay any positive net adjustments under this section to any school district are appropriated annually from the general fund to the commissioner of education.\nIncreases to any school districts under subdivision 1, clause (2), and decreases under subdivision 1, clauses (1) and (3), are limited to the fiscal year 1999 amounts. The commissioner of education may permanently reduce the adjustments to school districts under subdivision 1, clauses (1) and (2), in the same manner as prescribed for nonschool jurisdictions under section 273.1385, subdivision 2. The commissioner may, from time to time, require that the most recent fiscal year payroll information be certified by the executive director of the Teachers Retirement Association. For any school district where the newly certified Teachers Retirement Association payroll is significantly lower than the fiscal 1997 amount as determined by the commissioner, the commissioner shall recalculate the lower reduction under subdivision 1, clause (3), and shall permanently reduce the adjustment amount in subsequent years.\nThe commissioner of education shall reapportion the aid adjustments to school districts under this section to account for significant changes in boundaries or consolidations, as determined by the commissioner. If a school district is dissolved, or a school district function thereof is assumed by either the state or a nonpublic organization, adjustments for all or the appropriate fraction of the total payroll under this section must terminate.\nMS 2012 [Repealed, 2013 c 116 art 1 s 59]",
