	"text": "(a) Upon adoption of the next annual budget following the creation of a subordinate service district the county board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for the operation of the district including, as appropriate, either a property tax levied only on property within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the service within the district, or any combination of a property tax and a service charge.\n(b) A tax or service charge or a combination thereof shall not be imposed to finance a function or service in the subordinate service district which the county generally provides throughout the county unless an increase in the level of the service is to be supplied in the subordinate service district in which case, in addition to the countywide tax levy, only an amount necessary to pay for the increased level of service may be imposed.\nAt any time after the requirements of section 375B.07 have been met and the subordinate service district created, the county board may issue obligations in an amount it deems necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations shall be payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed pursuant to subdivision 1, net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter 429. The county board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the county to ensure payment of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service charges are insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance with chapter 475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not included in determining the net indebtedness of the county under the provisions of any law limiting indebtedness.\nIn resolutions authorizing the issuance of general or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the county board may make covenants for the protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the county as it deems necessary, including a covenant that the county will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal and interest when due on the obligations and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments as may be provided in the resolutions.\nIf obligations have been issued for the benefit of the subordinate service district, and the district is withdrawn or removed pursuant to either section 375B.10 or 375B.11, the rates, charges, and tax levies, if any, in the withdrawn or removed district must continue until the obligations and any obligations issued to refund them have been paid in full.",
