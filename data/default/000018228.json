	"text": "The legislature finds that the St. Anthony Falls area in Hennepin County and the city of Minneapolis has a concentration of outstanding and distinctive historical and architectural resources. There is a need to develop a comprehensive plan to interpret historical resources in that area to start the process of encouraging development of that area's historical resources. Sections 138.761 to 138.765 provide incentives for a joint board to develop and implement a comprehensive interpretive plan for the St. Anthony Falls area, complementing existing planning and development activities on the riverfront by using state, federal, and local funding for historic interpretation.",
