	"text": "In addition to the remedies and procedures applicable to the health-related licensing board provided in chapter 214, the board's complaint review committee, on behalf of the board, may issue and have served upon a person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from the unauthorized practice of veterinary medicine, or from violating or threatening to violate a statute, rule, or order which the board has authority to enforce. The order must be calculated to give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing and must state the reasons for the entry of the order.\nService of an order under this section is effective if the order is served on the person or counsel of record personally or by United States mail to the most recent address provided to the board for the person or counsel of record.\nUnless otherwise agreed by the complaint review committee and the person requesting the hearing, the hearing must be held no later than 30 days after the written request for the hearing is received by the complaint review committee.\nThe administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days of the close of the contested case hearing record. Within 30 days after receiving the report and any exceptions to it, the board shall issue a further order vacating, modifying, or making permanent the cease and desist order as the facts require.\nIf no hearing is requested within 30 days of service of the order, the order becomes final and remains in effect until it is modified or vacated by the board.\nIf the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person is in default and the proceeding may be determined against that person upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be considered to be true.",
