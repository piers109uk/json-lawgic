The court shall enter an order thereon. The commissioner shall immediately submit to the state Historical Society a copy of the court order, and on written application of the Historical Society within three months after receipt from the commissioner of the copy of the court order, the commissioner shall deliver to the society such records which are to be disposed of as the society deems of historical significance and shall destroy the remainder, whether or not the records have been photographed or otherwise reproduced.
