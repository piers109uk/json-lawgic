	"text": "The board may fix a date not more than 60 days, or a shorter time period provided in the articles or bylaws, before the date of a meeting of members as the date for the determination of the owners of membership interests entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a date is so fixed, only members on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of members.\nUnless otherwise provided in the articles, bylaws, or a member control agreement, members have voting power as provided in section 308B.545.\nThe articles or bylaws may give or prescribe the manner of giving a creditor, security holder, or other person a right to vote on patron membership interests under this section.\nMembership interests owned by two or more members may be voted by any one of them unless the cooperative receives written notice from any one of them denying the authority of that person to vote those membership interests.\nExcept as provided in subdivision 4, an owner of a nonpatron membership interest or a patron membership interest with more than one vote that is entitled to vote may vote any portion of the membership interest in any way the member chooses. If a member votes without designating the proportion voted in a particular way, the member is considered to have voted all of the membership interest in that way.",
