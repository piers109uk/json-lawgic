	"text": "A packer, market agency, or dealer purchasing livestock shall, before the close of the next business day following the purchase of livestock and transfer of its possession, deliver to the seller or the seller's authorized representative the full amount of the purchase price. If a packer, market agency, or dealer is purchasing livestock for slaughter, that person shall, before the close of the next business day following purchase of livestock and transfer of its possession, actually deliver at the point of transfer of possession to the seller or the seller's authorized representative a check or shall wire transfer funds to the seller's account for the full amount of the purchase price; or, in the case of a purchase on a carcass or \"grade and yield\" basis, the purchaser shall make payment by check at the point of transfer of possession or shall wire transfer funds to the seller's account for the full amount of the purchase price not later than the close of the first business day following determination of the purchase price. If the seller or a duly authorized representative is not present to receive payment at the point of transfer of possession, the packer, market agency, or dealer shall wire funds or place a check in the United States mail for the full amount of the purchase price properly addressed to the seller within the time limits specified in this section, and that action complies with the requirement for prompt payment.\nNotwithstanding subdivision 1 and subject to terms and conditions the commissioner may prescribe, the parties to the purchase and sale of livestock may expressly agree in writing, before the purchase or sale, to effect payment in a manner other than that required in subdivision 1. The agreement must be disclosed in the records of the market agency or dealer selling the livestock, and in the purchaser's records and on the accounts or other documents issued by the purchaser relating to the transaction.\nAny delay or attempt to delay by a market agency, dealer, or packer purchasing livestock, the collection of funds under this section, or otherwise for the purpose of or resulting in extending the normal period of payment for the livestock is an \"unfair practice\" in violation of this chapter.",
