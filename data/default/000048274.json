A separate appointment of agent shall not be necessary for each certificate of release. For registered land the appointment of agent shall be shown as a memorial on each certificate of title on which a mortgage to be released by a certificate of release under this section is a memorial. The appointment of agent may be rerecorded where necessary to establish authority of the agent, but such authority shall continue until a revocation of appointment is recorded in the office of the county recorder, or registrar of titles, where the appointment of agent was recorded.\nFor purposes of releasing the mortgage, a certificate of release containing the information and statements provided for in subdivision 3 and executed as provided in this section is prima facie evidence of the facts contained in it, is entitled to be recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, and operates as a release of the mortgage described in the certificate of release. The county recorder and the registrar of titles shall rely upon it to release the mortgage. Recording of a wrongful or erroneous certificate of release by a title insurer or its agent shall not relieve the mortgagor, or the mortgagor's successors or assigns, from any personal liability on the loan or other obligations secured by the mortgage. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurer wrongfully or erroneously recording a certificate of release under this section shall be liable to the mortgagee for actual damage sustained due to the recordings of the certificate of release.\nIf a mortgage is recorded in more than one county and a certificate of release is recorded in one of them, a certified copy of the certificate of release may be recorded in another county with the same effect as the original. In all cases, the certificate of release shall be entered and indexed as satisfactions of mortgage and releases of assignments of rents and profits are entered and indexed.\nThis section applies only to a mortgage in the original principal amount of $1,500,000 or less.",
