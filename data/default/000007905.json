	"text": "In the event of a community network insolvency, the commissioner shall determine whether one or more community networks or health plan companies are willing and able to provide replacement coverage to all of the failed community network's enrollees, and if so, the commissioner shall facilitate the provision of the replacement coverage. If such replacement coverage is not available, the commissioner shall randomly assign enrollees of the insolvent community network to other community networks and health plan companies in the service area, in proportion to their market share, for the remaining terms of the enrollees' contracts with the insolvent network. The other community networks and health plan companies must accept the allocated enrollees under their policy or contract most similar to the enrollees' contracts with the insolvent community network. The allocation must keep groups together. Enrollees with special continuity of care needs may, in the commissioner's discretion, be given a choice of replacement coverage rather than random assignment. Individuals and groups that are assigned randomly may choose a different community network or health plan company when their contracts expire, on the same basis as any other individual or group. The replacement health plan company must comply with any guaranteed renewal or other renewal provisions of the prior coverage, including but not limited to, provisions regarding preexisting conditions and health conditions that developed during prior coverage.",
