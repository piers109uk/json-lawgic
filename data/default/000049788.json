	"text": "The person paying, delivering, transferring, or issuing personal property or the evidence thereof pursuant to an affidavit meeting the requirements of section 524.3-1201 is discharged and released to the same extent as if the person dealt with a personal representative of the decedent. The person is not required to see to the application of the personal property or evidence thereof or to inquire into the truth of any statement in the affidavit. In particular, the person delivering the contents of a safe deposit box is not required to inquire into the value of the contents of the box and is authorized to rely solely upon the representation in the affidavit concerning the value of the entire probate estate. If any person to whom an affidavit is delivered refuses to pay, deliver, transfer, or issue any personal property or evidence thereof, it may be recovered or its payment, delivery, transfer, or issuance compelled upon proof of their right in a proceeding brought for the purpose by or on behalf of the persons entitled thereto. Any person to whom payment, delivery, transfer or issuance is made is answerable and accountable therefor to any personal representative of the estate or to any other person having a superior right.",
