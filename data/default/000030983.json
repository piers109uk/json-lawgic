	"text": "The admissions criteria for the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Red Wing shall include a requirement that the county of referral must have considered all appropriate local or regional placements and have exhausted potential in-state placements in the geographic region. The court must state on the record that this effort was made and placements rejected before ordering a placement or commitment to the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Red Wing. Before a court orders a disposition under section 260B.198 or 260B.130, subdivision 4, for a child, the court shall determine whether the child meets the established admissions criteria for the Minnesota Correctional Facility-Red Wing. If the child meets the admissions criteria, the court shall place the child at the facility and may not place the child in an out-of-state facility, unless the court makes a finding on the record that the safety of the child or the safety of the community can be best met by placement in an out-of-state facility or that the out-of-state facility is located closer to the child's home.\n[Repealed, 2009 c 59 art 4 s 9; 2009 c 83 art 3 s 24]",
