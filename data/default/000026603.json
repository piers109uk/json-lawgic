	"text": "At each grade crossing not equipped with flashing lights or flashing lights and gates where, because of the dangers attendant upon its use, the reasonable protection of life and property makes it necessary for persons approaching the crossing to stop or yield before crossing the railroad tracks, stop signs or yield signs must be installed. When the government entity responsible for a road that crosses a railroad track deems it necessary to install stop signs or yield signs at that crossing, it shall petition the commissioner to order the installation of the stop signs or yield signs. The commissioner shall respond to the petition by investigating the conditions at the crossing to determine whether stop signs or yield signs should be installed at the crossing. On determining, after an investigation following a petition from a governmental agency or subdivision or on the commissioner's own motion, that stop signs or yield signs should be installed at a crossing, the commissioner shall designate the crossing as a stop crossing or yield crossing and shall notify the railway company operating the railroad at the crossing of this designation. Within 30 days after notification, the railway company shall erect the uniform stop crossing signs or yield crossing signs in accordance with the commissioner's order.\nWhen a stop sign or a yield sign has been erected at a railroad crossing, the driver of a vehicle approaching a railroad crossing shall stop or yield within 50 feet, but not less than ten feet, from the nearest track of the crossing and shall proceed only upon exercising due care.",
