	"text": "(a) The declaration shall allocate a fraction or percentage of the undivided interests in the common elements, common expenses and votes in the association to each unit in such manner that each of the items is equally allocated or is allocated according to the proportion of the area or volume of each unit to the area or volume of all units, and the items need not be allocated the same for all purposes. The declaration may provide that a portion of each common expense assessment may be allocated on the basis of equality and the remainder on the basis of area or volume of each unit. The sum of the percentages or fractions shall equal 100 percent or 1.\n(b) Except in the case of eminent domain (section 515A.1-107), expansion of a flexible condominium (section 515A.2-111), relocation of boundaries between adjoining units (section 515A.2-114), or subdivision of units (section 515A.2-115), the common element interest, votes and common expense liability allocated to any unit may not be altered, except as an amendment to the declaration which is signed by all unit owners and first mortgagees, and which complies with section 515A.2-119. The common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements without the unit to which the interest is allocated is void.\n(c) The association may assess certain common expenses against fewer than all units pursuant to section 515A.3-114.",
