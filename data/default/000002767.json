	"text": "The commissioner may collect license and permit surcharges on all licensing and permitting transactions conducted by the Department of Agriculture for which a fee is charged. The surcharge applies to all initial and renewal license and permit applications and is calculated based on the license or permit base fee. Late penalties or other assessments are not included in the calculation of the surcharge. The fee is set at five percent beginning August 1, 2023, with a minimum fee of $5 for each transaction. The surcharge rate must be reviewed and set annually by the commissioner and may be assessed at a rate of between three and eight percent of the licensing or permitting fee, with a minimum fee of $5 for each transaction. The fees collected for this surcharge must be deposited in a dedicated account in the agricultural fund. Money in the account, including interest, is appropriated to the commissioner for the information technology improvement activities needed to create electronic systems for conducting licensing and permitting transactions and to modernize the department's inspection and customer management systems.",
