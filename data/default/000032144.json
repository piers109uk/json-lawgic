	"text": "When by virtue of chapter 278, sections 270C.86, 375.192, or otherwise, the net tax capacity of a city or township for a taxable year is reduced after the taxes for the year have been spread by the county auditor, and when the local tax rate determined by the county auditor based on the original net tax capacity is applied on the reduced net tax capacity and does not produce the full amount of taxes actually levied and certified for that taxable year on the original net tax capacity, the city or township may include an additional amount in its tax levy made following final determination and notice of the reduction in net tax capacity. The amount shall equal the difference between the total amount of taxes actually levied and certified for that taxable year upon the original net tax capacity, not exceeding the maximum amount which could be raised on the net tax capacity as reduced, within existing local tax rate limitations, if any, and the amount of taxes collected for that taxable year on the reduced net tax capacity.\nThe amount of taxes so included shall be levied separately and shall be levied in addition to all limitations imposed by law; and further shall not result in any penalty in the nature of a reduction in state aid of any kind.",
