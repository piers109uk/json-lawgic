	"text": "Beginning January 1, 2026, a product manufacturer must annually provide a statement that a product contains no intentionally added PFAS or, for products that contain intentionally added PFAS, must submit to the commissioner the following information:\n(1) the name and purpose for which PFAS are used in the product, including in any product components;\n(2) the amount of each PFAS chemical, identified by its name, chemical structure, analytical methods, chemical abstracts service registry number, or other method approved by the commissioner, in the product; and\n(3) any additional information required by the commissioner.\nThe commissioner may waive all or part of the notification requirement under subdivision 1 if the commissioner determines that substantially equivalent information is available. The commissioner may extend the deadline for the submission of the information required under subdivision 1 if the commissioner determines that more time is needed by the manufacturer to comply with the submission requirement. With the approval of the commissioner, a manufacturer may supply the information for a category or type of product rather than for each individual product. This may include raw materials used to produce blended fertilizers.\nBeginning January 1, 2032, the commissioner must not register or approve a product for use under this chapter if the product contains intentionally added PFAS unless the commissioner determines that the use of PFAS is a currently unavoidable use.",
