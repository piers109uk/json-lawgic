	"text": "Any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter may obtain injunctive relief, damages, rescission, or other relief. It is not a defense to an action for injunctive relief that an aggrieved person may have adequate remedies at law. A party shall submit the dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial rules of the Minnesota American Arbitration Association. Injunctive relief shall remain available in a court of competent jurisdiction where arbitration cannot provide complete relief to vindicate the rights of either party or where appropriate to secure rights after arbitration. The court or arbitrator shall have the discretion to award to the prevailing party its costs and disbursements. No action may be commenced under this chapter more than three years after the cause of action accrued. If the marketing agreement provides for the right of the supplier to recover attorney fees as the prevailing party in a suit between the parties, then the dealer shall have the right to recover attorney fees as the prevailing party in an action under this marketing agreement or under this chapter.",
