	"text": "If an employing unit is dissolved or closed and amounts are owed to more than one Minnesota public pension plan, any amounts available to cover payments to the plans must be applied first to the employee contributions owed to the applicable plans, and next to the unpaid employer contributions, including any applicable employer additional contributions, and finally to the interest due on the employee and employer amounts. If, at any stage in this allocation process, the available amount is insufficient to fully cover the amount required, the remaining available payment amount must be prorated among the applicable plans based on each plan's share of combined covered payroll.",
