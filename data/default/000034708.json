	"text": "A cemetery association organized under state law before April 25, 1913, that does not have a capital stock and that has acquired a burial site and sold lots from it may reorganize as provided in subdivision 2 if the management of the association is confined to the original members of the association either by the statutes then in force or by the certificate of organization.\nAny two or more of the original members of the association, or if all the original members are deceased then any three or more of the lot owners in the burial site, may call a meeting of the association. The meeting must be held at a time and place designated in the notice in the city nearest to the cemetery site for the purpose of reorganizing the association. The notice must be published for two successive weeks in a legal newspaper printed in the place in which the meeting is to be held and must give at least 30 days' notice of the meeting.\nAt the time and place mentioned in the notice those present shall organize and proceed to prepare and adopt, or authorize to be prepared and adopted, articles of reassociation conforming to the requirements of state law for the organization of public cemetery associations. The articles must name the first board of trustees and other officers as the meeting determines. A majority of the trustees and officers must be named and elected from the members of the old association if there are sufficient survivors living in the county where the site is located or in adjoining counties.\nThe trustees and officers, as soon as the certificate of reassociation is adopted and recorded with the county recorder in the county where the cemetery is located, have the powers, duties, rights, and liabilities provided by state law pertaining to cemetery associations.",
