	"text": "The commissioner shall include in rules setting turkey seasons the methods for issuing licenses for those seasons.\nPersons eligible for a turkey license shall be determined by this section and commissioner's rule.\nAn application for a turkey license must be on a form provided by the commissioner and accompanied by a $4 application fee. A person may not make more than one application for each season. If a person makes more than one application the person is ineligible for a license for that season after determination by the commissioner, without a hearing.\n(a) The commissioner may conduct a separate selection for up to 20 percent of the turkey licenses to be issued for any area. Only persons who are owners or tenants of and who live on at least 40 acres of land in the permit area, and their family members who live on the qualifying land, are eligible applicants for turkey licenses for the separate selection. The qualifying land may be noncontiguous. Persons who are unsuccessful in a separate selection must be included in the selection for the remaining licenses. Persons who obtain a license in a separate selection must allow public turkey hunting on their land during that turkey season. A license issued under this subdivision is restricted to the permit area where the qualifying land is located.\n(b) The commissioner may by rule establish criteria for determining eligible family members under this subdivision.\n[Repealed, 1Sp2011 c 2 art 5 s 70]",
