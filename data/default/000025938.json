	"text": "Notwithstanding any other provision of rule or policy to the contrary, every public utility providing natural gas or electricity at retail shall make a reasonable effort to obtain readings at least once every 18 months from nonaccessible meters. Readings shall be obtained at times that meet the needs of customer schedules. Utilities shall make a reasonable effort to provide evening and Saturday or Sunday meter reading service at no extra charge to a customer whose work or other schedule makes a business hour reading of meters a hardship. Utilities may refuse to read a customer's meter during nondaylight hours if such activity could threaten the safety of the utility meter-reading employee.\nA utility may also allow a customer to self-read the customer's meter for periods of time not to exceed 18 months, provided that the customer is reminded periodically of the potentially serious financial consequences of errors in self-reading.\nA utility may terminate service to a customer who refuses to allow a utility company employee access to a nonaccessible meter for a period of 18 months or more.",
