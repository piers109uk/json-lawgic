	"text": "Every grand and petit juror drawn and summoned to attend and serve at any term of a district court shall report to such court at the time and place designated in such summons. A failure to so report shall constitute contempt of court. On the first day of the term fixed for the attendance of either the grand or the petit jurors, or as soon thereafter as may be, the court shall ascertain whether the persons summoned to attend at such term as grand or petit jurors, as the case may be, have reported for duty as required by law; and, if it shall find a failure on the part of any person so summoned to report, it shall at once cause an attachment to issue against the juror, which shall be served by the sheriff or a deputy, and shall be forthwith arrested and brought before the court to be dealt with according to law. Nothing in this section contained shall render liable to jury duty any person who is exempt by law.",
