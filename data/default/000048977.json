	"text": "Each case shall be submitted to a panel of at least three judges. The decision of a majority of the judges to which it is submitted shall be the decision of the court.\nIn assigning judges to panels, the chief judge shall rotate assignments, so that as nearly as practicable, each judge serves a proportionate time with every other judge. The chief judge shall also rotate assignments to various locations for hearings.\n(a) A decision shall be rendered in every case within 90 days after oral argument or after the final submission of briefs or memoranda by the parties, whichever is later. The chief justice or the chief judge may waive the 90-day limitation for any proceeding before the court of appeals for good cause shown. In every case, the decision of the court, including any written opinion containing a summary of the case and a statement of the reasons for its decision, shall be indexed and made readily available.\n(b) The decision of the court need not include a written opinion. A statement of the decision without a written opinion must not be officially published and must not be cited as precedent, except as law of the case, res judicata, or collateral estoppel.\nThe Rules of Appellate Procedure may provide for the decision of interlocutory or procedural matters by a single judge.",
