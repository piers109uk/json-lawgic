	"text": "(a) The board may issue a cease and desist order to stop a person from violating or threatening to violate a statute, rule, or order which the board has issued or has authority to enforce. The cease and desist order must state the reason for its issuance and give notice of the person's right to request a hearing under sections 14.57 to 14.62. If, within 15 days of service of the order, the subject of the order fails to request a hearing in writing, the order is the final order of the board and is not reviewable by a court or agency.\n(b) A hearing must be initiated by the board not later than 30 days from the date of the board's receipt of a written hearing request. Within 30 days of receipt of the administrative law judge's report, and any written agreement or exceptions filed by the parties, the board shall issue a final order modifying, vacating, or making permanent the cease and desist order as the facts require. The final order remains in effect until modified or vacated by the board.\n(c) When a request for a stay accompanies a timely hearing request, the board may, in the board's discretion, grant the stay. If the board does not grant a requested stay, the board shall refer the request to the Office of Administrative Hearings within three working days of receipt of the request. Within ten days after receiving the request from the board, an administrative law judge shall issue a recommendation to grant or deny the stay. The board shall grant or deny the stay within five working days of receiving the administrative law judge's recommendation.\n(d) In the event of noncompliance with a cease and desist order, the board may institute a proceeding in district court to obtain injunctive relief or other appropriate relief, including a civil penalty payable to the board, not to exceed $10,000 for each separate violation.\nIn addition to any other remedy provided by law, including the issuance of a cease and desist order under subdivision 1, the board may in the board's own name bring an action in district court for injunctive relief to restrain an alcohol and drug counselor from a violation or threatened violation of any statute, rule, or order which the board has authority to administer, enforce, or issue.\nThe issuance of a cease and desist order or injunctive relief granted under this section does not relieve a counselor from criminal prosecution by a competent authority or from disciplinary action by the board.",
