The hearing shall be held not earlier than 10 days nor later than 30 days after the date of service of the notice, unless an earlier or later date is set by the commissioner at the request of the director, trustee, officer, or other person and for good cause shown. Unless the director, trustee, officer, or other person appears at the hearing in person or by a duly authorized representative, that person shall be deemed to have consented to the issuance of an order of removal or prohibition. In the event of consent, or if upon the record made at the hearing the commissioner finds that any of the grounds specified in the notice has been established, the commissioner may issue such orders of suspension, removal from office, or prohibition from participation in the conduct of the affairs of the institution as the commissioner deems appropriate. The order shall become effective at the expiration of 30 days after service upon the institution and the director, trustee, officer, or other person concerned, except in the case of an order issued upon consent which shall become effective at the time specified therein. The order shall remain effective and enforceable until it is stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by action of the commissioner or a reviewing court.",
