	"text": "The commissioner must:\n(1) promulgate rules necessary to the operation of sections 124D.12 to 124D.127;\n(2) cooperate with and provide supervision of flexible learning year programs to determine compliance with the provisions of sections 124D.12 to 124D.127, the commissioner's standards and qualifications, and the proposed program as submitted and approved;\n(3) provide any necessary adjustments of (a) attendance and membership computations and (b) the dates and percentages of apportionment of state aids; and\n(4) consistent with the definition of \"average daily membership\" in section 126C.05, subdivision 8, furnish the board of a district implementing a flexible learning year program with a formula for computing average daily membership. This formula must be computed so that tax levies to be made by the district, state aids to be received by the district, and any and all other formulas based upon average daily membership are not affected solely as a result of adopting this plan of instruction.\nSections 124D.12 to 124D.127 may not be construed to authorize the commissioner to require the establishment of a flexible learning year program in any district in which the board has not voted to establish, maintain, and operate such a program.",
