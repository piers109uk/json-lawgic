For purposes of this provision, funds from a premium finance loan are considered assets of the insured or that person only if the insured or that person is contractually obligated to repay the full amount of the loan and to pledge personal assets, other than the policy itself, for loan amounts exceeding the policy's cash value; and\n(ii) the insured underwent a life expectancy evaluation within the 18-month time period immediately prior to the issuance of the policy and, during the same time period, the results of the life expectancy evaluation were shared with or used by any person for the purpose of determining the actual or potential value of the policy in the secondary market.\nThe rebuttable presumption created in this section does not apply in any criminal proceeding.",
