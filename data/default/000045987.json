	"text": "Notwithstanding section 179A.13, subdivision 2, it is not an unfair labor practice for a political subdivision to specify an amount of funds to be used solely to correct inequitable compensation relationships. A political subdivision may specify an amount of funds to be used for general salary increases. The provisions of sections 471.991 to 471.999 do not diminish a political subdivision's duty to bargain in good faith under chapter 179A or sections 179.35 to 179.39.",
