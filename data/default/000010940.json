	"text": "The purpose of this section is to extinguish the school trust interest in school trust lands where long-term economic return is prohibited by designation or policy while producing economic benefits for Minnesota's public schools. For the purposes of satisfying the Minnesota Constitution, article XI, section 8, which limits the sale of school trust lands to a public sale, the commissioner of natural resources shall acquire school trust lands through condemnation, as provided in subdivision 2.\nWhen the commissioner of natural resources has determined sufficient money is available to acquire any of the lands identified under section 84.027, subdivision 18, paragraph (c), the commissioner shall proceed to extinguish the school trust interest by condemnation action. When requested by the commissioner, the attorney general shall commence condemnation of the identified school trust lands.\nThe portion of the payment of the award and judgment that is for the value of the land shall be deposited into the permanent school fund. The remainder of the award and judgment payment shall first be remitted for reimbursement to the accounts from which expenses were paid, with any remainder deposited into the permanent school fund.\nThe school trust lands account is created in the state treasury. Money credited to the account is appropriated to the commissioner of natural resources for the purposes of this section.",
