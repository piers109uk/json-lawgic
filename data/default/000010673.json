	"text": "It shall be the duty of the engineer from time to time as occasion may require to visit the premises and examine the work performed by the contractor and when and as often as ten percent or more of the work is completed the engineer may issue a certificate to the contractor and a duplicate to the county auditor, therein certifying the amount of work that has been done by the contractor and the value thereof. Upon the filing by the contractor of such certificate with the county auditor, the auditor may draw a warrant in favor of the contractor for a sum not to exceed 75 percent of the contract price of the work done since the last report. When the contractor shall have notified the engineer of the completion of the work, the engineer shall make careful examination and report findings of fact to the county auditor; and, on finding the contract to be completed in accordance with the terms thereof, the engineer shall so certify. Thereupon the county auditor shall notify the owners of the land that a hearing will be had upon the report of the engineer that the contract is completed, which hearing shall be held by the county board at the next meeting following the filing of the report, if not less than 15 days thereafter; otherwise, as soon as possible. At the hearing all parties interested may appear before the county board; and, if the county board shall find the contract fully completed, it shall order payment of the balance owing under the contract.",
