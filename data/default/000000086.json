The emergency temporary location, or locations, shall remain the seat of government until the legislature by law establishes a new location, or locations, or until the emergency is declared to be ended by the governor and the seat of government is returned to its normal location.\nWhile the seat of government remains at an emergency temporary location, or locations, all official acts required by law to be performed at the seat of government by any officer, agency, department or authority of this state, including the convening and meeting of the legislature in regular, extraordinary, or emergency session, shall be as valid and binding when performed at the emergency temporary location, or locations, as if performed at the normal location of the seat of government.\nWhen, due to an emergency resulting from the effects of enemy attack, or the anticipated effects of a threatened enemy attack, it becomes imprudent, inexpedient or impossible to conduct the affairs of local government at their regular or usual place or places, the governing body of each political subdivision of this state may meet at any place in or out of the territorial limits of the political subdivision on the call of the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body, and shall designate by ordinance, resolution or other manner, alternate or substitute places as the emergency temporary location, or locations, of government where all, or any part, of the public business may be conducted during the emergency situation. The places may be in or out of the territorial limits of the political subdivision and the state.\nWhile the public business is being conducted at the emergency temporary location, or locations, the governing body and other officers of a political subdivision shall exercise, at the location, or locations, all of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and functions conferred upon it and its officers by its charter and the laws and constitution of this state. Acts of the governing body and officers shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the territorial limits of their political subdivision.\nThis section shall be supreme if it is employed notwithstanding any other statute, charter or ordinance.",
