	"text": "The commissioner of human services may make grants to nonprofit organizations, municipalities or local units of government to provide up to 25 percent of the cost of constructing, purchasing or remodeling small community residential facilities for persons with developmental disabilities allowing such persons to live in a homelike atmosphere near their families. Operating capital grants may also be made for up to three months of reimbursable operating costs after the facility begins processing applications for admission and prior to reimbursement for services. Repayment of the operating grants shall be made to the commissioner of human services at the end of the provider's first fiscal year, or at the conclusion of the interim rate period, whichever occurs first. No aid under this section shall be granted to a facility providing for more than 16 residents in a living unit and with more than two living units. Prior to any disbursement of funds the commissioner shall review the plans and location of any proposed facility to determine whether such a facility is needed. The commissioner shall promulgate such rules for the making of grants and for the administration of this section as the commissioner deems proper. The remaining portion of the cost of constructing, purchasing, remodeling facilities, or of operating capital shall be borne by nonstate sources including federal grants, local government funds, funds from charitable sources, gifts and mortgages.",
