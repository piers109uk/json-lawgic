Upon application by any sheriff, chief of police, or other peace officer in the state, or by an officer of the United States or by an officer of another state, territory, or government duly authorized to receive the same and effecting reciprocal interchange of similar information with the division, it shall be the duty of the bureau to furnish all information in its possession pertaining to the identification of any person. If the bureau has a sealed record on the arrested person, it shall notify the requesting peace officer of that fact and of the right to seek a court order to open the record for purposes of law enforcement. A criminal justice agency shall be notified, upon request, of the existence and contents of a sealed record containing conviction information about an applicant for employment. For purposes of this section a \"criminal justice agency\" means courts or a government agency that performs the administration of criminal justice under statutory authority.",
