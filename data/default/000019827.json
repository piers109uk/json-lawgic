	"text": "Under the powers and duties assigned to the commissioner in this chapter and chapter 145, the commissioner may proceed under sections 144.4801 to 144.4813 whenever the commissioner has probable cause to believe that a person who has active tuberculosis or is clinically suspected of having active tuberculosis is an endangerment to the public health.\nSections 144.4801 to 144.4813 preempt and supersede sections 144.4171 to 144.4186 with regard to a tuberculosis health threat. Nothing in sections 144.4801 to 144.4813 restricts the commissioner's authority to seek injunctive relief pursuant to section 145.075, or any other relief under other statutes or at common law.\nNothing in sections 144.4801 to 144.4813 shall be construed to abridge the right of a carrier to refuse medical treatment for tuberculosis if the carrier opposes medical treatment on the basis of sincere religious beliefs and complies with a monitoring plan developed by the commissioner for the isolation of the carrier as defined in section 144.4803, subdivision 14. A carrier who meets the requirements of this subdivision is not considered an endangerment under section 144.4803, subdivision 10, clauses (2) to (6) and (8). Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the authority of the commissioner to take necessary actions to protect the public health according to sections 144.4801 to 144.4813.",
