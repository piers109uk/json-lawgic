	"text": "(a) The commissioner shall establish a facility fee payment mechanism that will pay a facility fee to all enrolled outpatient hospitals for each emergency room or outpatient clinic visit provided on or after July 1, 1989. This payment mechanism may not result in an overall increase in outpatient payment rates. This section does not apply to federally mandated maximum payment limits, department-approved program packages, or services billed using a nonoutpatient hospital provider number.\n(b) For fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2002, the total payment, before third-party liability and spenddown, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services is reduced by .5 percent from the current statutory rates.\n(c) In addition to the reduction in paragraph (b), the total payment for fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2003, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced five percent from the current statutory rates. Facilities defined under section 256.969, subdivision 16, are excluded from this paragraph.\n(d) In addition to the reductions in paragraphs (b) and (c), the total payment for fee-for-service services provided on or after July 1, 2008, made to hospitals for outpatient hospital facility services before third-party liability and spenddown, is reduced three percent from the current statutory rates. Mental health services and facilities defined under section 256.969, subdivision 16, are excluded from this paragraph.\nEffective for services provided on or after July 1, 2003, rates that are based on the Medicare outpatient prospective payment system shall be replaced by a budget-neutral prospective payment system that is derived using medical assistance data.",
