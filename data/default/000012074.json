	"text": "If the landowner and the local government do not agree to a mediated settlement or if the landowner has refused mediation, the county attorney may petition the district court for a hearing. The landowner shall have the opportunity to present the landowner's conservation plan and time schedule as an alternative to the local government conservation plan and time schedule. The court shall order the landowner to implement the conservation plan and time schedule that is the least burdensome to the landowner and will reduce soil loss to at least the soil loss limit. The court may amend the local government's or landowner's conservation plan and time schedule, or develop a new conservation plan and time schedule. The court shall set times to implement, make satisfactory progress, and complete the conservation plan.\n(a) If the court orders implementation of the landowner's conservation plan and time schedule, or amends the conservation plan and time schedule, or if the court develops a new conservation plan and time schedule, the landowner is eligible to apply for 75 percent cost-share funds for permanent conservation practices. The landowner must apply for the cost share within 90 days after the court order. If the landowner does not apply within 90 days for the cost-sharing funds the cost share is reduced to 50 percent. The court shall establish a time after which the landowner is no longer eligible for cost-sharing funds if an application is not made.\n(b) If the court orders a plan and time schedule developed by the district in its report, the landowner is eligible for 50 percent cost share if the landowner applies within 90 days after the court order.",
