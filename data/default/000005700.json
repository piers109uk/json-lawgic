The time and manner of their election and their respective duties must be prescribed in the certificate of incorporation or in the bylaws. Only one president of record may act on behalf of the savings bank; however, additional officers may be titled president for purposes of empowering those additional officers to function as managing officers of detached facilities of banks.",
