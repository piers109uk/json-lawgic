	"text": "The commissioner shall decrease by five percent rates for adult foster care and supportive living services that are reimbursed under section 256B.092 or 256B.49, and are above the 95th percentile of the statewide rates for the service. The reduction in rates shall take into account the acuity of individuals served based on the methodology used to allocate dollars to local lead agency budgets, and assure that affected service rates are not reduced below the rate level represented by the above percentile due to this rate change. Lead agency contracts for services specified in this section shall be amended to implement these rate changes for services rendered on or after July 1, 2009. The commissioner shall make corresponding reductions to waiver allocations and capitated rates.",
