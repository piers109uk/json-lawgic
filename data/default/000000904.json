	"text": "A program participant who is otherwise eligible to vote may register with the secretary of state as a permanent absentee voter. Notwithstanding section 203B.04, subdivision 5, the secretary of state is not required to send an absentee ballot application prior to each election to a program participant registered as a permanent absentee voter under this section. As soon as practicable before each election, the secretary of state shall determine the precinct in which the residential address of a program participant is located. Upon making a precinct determination, the secretary of state shall either (1) request from and receive from the county auditor or other election official the ballot for that precinct and mail the absentee ballot to the program participant, or (2) using the Minnesota statewide voter registration system, prepare the program participant's ballot for that precinct and mail the absentee ballot to the program participant. The secretary of state shall include with each mailed absentee ballot all corresponding materials for absentee balloting as required by Minnesota law. The program participant shall complete the ballot and return it to the secretary of state, who shall review the ballot in the manner provided by section 203B.121, subdivision 2. If the ballot and ballot materials comply with the requirements of that section, the ballot must be certified by the secretary of state as the ballot of a program participant, and must be forwarded to the appropriate electoral jurisdiction for tabulation along with all other ballots. The name and address of a program participant must not be listed in the statewide voter registration system.",
