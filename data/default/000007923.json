	"text": "The commissioner may approve a request for waiver under section 62T.06 if the applicant demonstrates that the contracting arrangement between a health care purchasing alliance and an accountable provider network will meet the following criteria:\n(a) The arrangement would be likely to result in:\n(1) more choice in benefits and prices;\n(2) lower costs;\n(3) increased access to health care coverage by small businesses;\n(4) increased access to providers who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the community being serviced; or\n(5) increased quality of health care than would otherwise occur under the existing market conditions. In the event that a proposed arrangement appears likely to improve one or two of the criteria at the expense of another one or two of the criteria, the commissioner shall not approve the waiver.\n(b) The proposed alternative methods would provide equal or improved results in consumer protection than would result under the existing consumer protections requirements.",
