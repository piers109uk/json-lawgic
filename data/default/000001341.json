	"text": "The dollar amounts in section 10A.25, subdivision 2, must be adjusted for general election years as provided in this section. Each general election year, the executive director of the board must determine the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index from December of the year preceding the last general election year to December of the year preceding the year in which the determination is made. The dollar amounts used for the preceding general election year must be multiplied by that percentage. The product of the calculation must be added to each dollar amount to produce the dollar limitations to be in effect for the next general election. The product must be rounded up to the next highest $100 increment. The index used must be the revised Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers for the St. Paul-Minneapolis metropolitan area prepared by the United States Department of Labor.\n[Repealed, 1999 c 220 s 51]\nBy April 15 of each election year the board must publish on its website the expenditure limit for each office for that calendar year under section 10A.25 as adjusted by this section.
