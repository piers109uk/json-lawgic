	"text": "To determine the effectiveness of home care in providing or arranging for the care and services which would normally be provided in a nursing home, the commissioner of human services may establish an experimental program to subsidize a limited number of eligible agencies or households which agree to carry out a planned program of in-home care for an elderly or physically disabled person. The household or agency to provide the services shall be selected by the person who will receive the services.\nThis program shall be limited to agencies or households caring for persons with a physical disability or persons 60 years of age or older, and who otherwise would require and be eligible for placement in a nursing home.\nGrants to eligible agencies or households shall be determined by the commissioner of human services. In determining the grants, the commissioner shall consider the cost of diagnostic assessments, homemaker services, specialized equipment, visiting nurses' or other pertinent therapists' costs, social services, day program costs, and related transportation expenses, not to exceed 50 percent of the average medical assistance reimbursement rate for nursing homes in the region of the person's residence.\nAn individual care plan for the person shall be established and agreed upon by the person or agency providing the care, the person or agency receiving the subsidy, the person receiving the care, and the appropriate local welfare agency. The plan shall be periodically evaluated to determine the person's progress.",
