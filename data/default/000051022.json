Every undertaking shall save and secure all rights and liabilities to the same extent as a bond. The damages presumed to accrue to the party against whom the proceeding is taken shall be deemed a sufficient consideration for the undertaking, though no consideration is mentioned in it. No undertaking or bond need be given upon any appeal or other proceeding instituted in favor of the state, or any county, city, town, or school district in it, or of any executor or administrator as such.",
