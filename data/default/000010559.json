The research effort will be concentrated on such important problems as means of reproducing basswood, development of planting stock, selection of superior strains of these species, methods of field planting, management of existing stands, and methods of increasing the representation of these species in woodlands and forests in need of rehabilitation because of past damage from high-grading, burning, and grazing.",
