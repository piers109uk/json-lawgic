	"text": "If the board determines that a drainage system has been obstructed, including by the installation of bridges or culverts of insufficient hydraulic capacity, the board shall notify the person or public authority responsible for the obstruction as soon as possible and direct the responsible party to remove the obstruction or show the board why the obstruction should not be removed. The board must set a time and location in the notice for the responsible person to appear before the board.\nIf the obstruction is on private property, the owner is responsible for the obstruction unless the owner proves otherwise. The owner must be notified by certified mail at least ten days before the hearing.\nThe board shall hear all interested parties and if the board determines that the drainage system has been obstructed by a person or public authority, the board shall order the obstruction removed by the responsible party within a reasonable time set in the order. If the obstruction is not removed by the prescribed time, the board shall have the obstruction removed and the auditor shall make a statement of the removal cost. The statement must be filed in the county recorder's office as a lien on the property where the obstruction is located or against the responsible party. The lien must be enforced and collected as liens for drainage repairs under this chapter, except that a lien may not be filed against private property if the board determines that the owner of the property is not responsible for the obstruction. The lien may be enforced against the responsible party by civil action.",
