	"text": "(a) If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a criminal gang constitutes a public nuisance, the court may enter a temporary or permanent order:\n(1) enjoining a defendant in the suit from engaging in the gang activities; and\n(2) imposing other reasonable requirements to prevent the defendant from engaging in future gang activities.\n(b) \"Reasonable requirement\" as specified in paragraph (a), clause (2), means an injunctive limitation on gang behavior and social interaction that reduces the opportunity for gang activity. The court in imposing reasonable requirements must balance state interests in public safety against constitutional freedoms.\n(c) If the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a place is continuously or regularly used in a manner that constitutes a public nuisance, the court may include in its order reasonable requirements to prevent the use of the place for gang activity. This may include cancellation of any applicable lease pursuant to the procedures in section 617.85 that may involve any tenant or lessee who has maintained or conducted the public nuisance, or other reasonable requirements established in the order.",
