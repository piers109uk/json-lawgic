Oil overcharge money may not be spent until it is specifically appropriated by law.\nThe legislature intends to appropriate one-half of the oil overcharge money for projects that have been reviewed and recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources. A work plan must be prepared for each proposed project for review by the commission. The commission must recommend specific projects to the legislature.\n[Repealed, 1998 c 273 s 15]",
