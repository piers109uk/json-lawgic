If the unauthorized act, continuation, or performance sought to be enjoined is being, or to be, performed or made pursuant to a contract to which the corporation is a party, the court may, if just and reasonable in the circumstances, set aside and enjoin the performance of the contract and in so doing may allow to the corporation or to the other parties to the contract compensation for the loss or damage sustained as a result of the action of the court in setting aside and enjoining the performance of the contract;\n(b) In a proceeding by or in the name of the corporation, whether acting directly or through a legal representative, or through shareholders in a representative or derivative suit, against the incumbent or former officers or directors of the corporation for exceeding or otherwise violating their authority, or against a person having actual knowledge of the lack of power; or\n(c) In a proceeding by the attorney general, as provided in section 302A.757, to dissolve the corporation, or in a proceeding by the attorney general to enjoin the corporation from the transaction of unauthorized business.",
