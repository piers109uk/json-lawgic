Such order shall specify the effective date thereof, which may be immediate or may be at a later date, and such order shall remain in effect until withdrawn by the commissioner or until terminated by a court order. Such order of the commissioner, upon application made on or after the effective date thereof by the commissioner to a court of general jurisdiction in the county in which the principal office of the association is located, shall be enforced ex parte and without notice by an order to comply entered by said court. Such proceedings shall be given precedence over other cases pending in such court, and shall in every way be expedited. Any association affected by such order of the commissioner shall, after receipt thereof, have the right to apply within 30 days to any such court for an immediate hearing and order suspending the order of the commissioner until such time as the hearing has been completed.

The compensation of the conservator, as determined by the court, shall be paid by the association. A certified copy of the order of the court discharging such conservator and returning such association to the directors thereof shall be sufficient evidence thereof.\nAny conservator appointed shall have all the rights, powers, and privileges possessed by the officers, board of directors, and members of the association.\nThe conservator shall not retain special counsel or other experts, incur any expense other than normal operating expenses, or liquidate assets except in the ordinary course of operations.\nThe directors and officers shall remain in office and the employees shall remain in their respective positions, but the conservator may remove any director, officer, or employee, provided the order of removal of a director or officer shall be approved in writing by the commissioner.\nWhile the association is in the charge of a conservator, members of such association shall continue to make payments to the association in accordance with the terms and conditions of their contracts, and the conservator may permit savings account members to withdraw their accounts from the association pursuant to the provisions of sections 51A.01 to 51A.57 or under and subject to such rules as the commissioner may prescribe. The conservator shall have power to accept savings accounts and additions to savings accounts, but any such amounts received by the conservator may be segregated if the commissioner shall so order in writing; if so ordered, such amounts shall not be subject to offset and shall not be used to liquidate any indebtedness of such association existing at the time the conservator was appointed for it or any subsequent indebtedness incurred for the purposes of liquidating the indebtedness of any such association existing at the time such conservator was appointed.
