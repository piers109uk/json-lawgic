	"text": "The election or appointment of a person as an officer or agent does not, of itself, create contract rights. A corporation may enter into a contract with an officer or agent for a period of time if, in the board's judgment, the contract would be in the best interests of the corporation. The fact that the contract may be for a term longer than the terms of the directors who authorized or approved the contract does not make the contract void or voidable.",
