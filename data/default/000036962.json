	"text": "To the extent that the procedures established by sections 327.61 to 327.67 differ from the procedures established or authorized for repossession of a manufactured home under the Uniform Commercial Code of this state, the provisions of sections 327.61 to 327.67 shall supersede the code and shall govern the repossession of the manufactured home. The procedures established by sections 327.61 to 327.67 must be satisfied before a secured party may take any action pursuant to chapter 565.\nAffixing a manufactured home to real estate does not extinguish an otherwise valid security interest in the home. A manufactured home which is affixed to real estate while not encumbered by a valid security interest shall be treated as an improvement to real estate and sections 327.61 to 327.67 shall not apply to it. If real estate to which an unencumbered manufactured home has been affixed as an improvement is subject to proceedings under section 559.21 or chapter 580 or 581, the presence of the home on the real estate does not necessitate any changed or additional procedures.",
