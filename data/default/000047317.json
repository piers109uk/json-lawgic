	"text": "Notices or orders for income withholding or medical support issued pursuant to sections 518A.41 and 518A.53 are binding on the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds after the order or notice for income withholding or enforcement of medical support has been transmitted pursuant to section 518A.53 to the employer, trustee, or payor of funds.\nAn obligee or the public agency responsible for child support enforcement may initiate a contempt action against an employer, trustee, or payor of funds, within the action that created the support obligation, by serving an order to show cause upon the employer, trustee, or payor of funds.\nThe employer, trustee, or payor of funds is presumed to be in contempt:\n(1) if the employer, trustee, or payor of funds has intentionally failed to withhold support after receiving the order or notice for income withholding or notice of enforcement of medical support; or\n(2) upon presentation of pay stubs or similar documentation showing the employer, trustee, or payor of funds withheld support and demonstration that the employer, trustee, or payor of funds intentionally failed to remit support to the agency responsible for child support enforcement.\nThe employer, trustee, or payor of funds is liable to the obligee or the agency responsible for child support enforcement for any amounts required to be withheld that were not paid. The court may enter judgment against the employer, trustee, or payor of funds for support not withheld or remitted. An employer, trustee, or payor of funds found guilty of contempt shall be punished by a fine of not more than $250 as provided in chapter 588. The court may also impose other contempt sanctions authorized under chapter 588.",
