	"text": "In all counties of this state where the amount of clerk hire now or hereafter provided by law for any county office shall be insufficient to meet the requirements of said office, the county officer in need of additional clerk hire shall prepare a petition and statement setting forth therein the amount of additional clerk hire needed and file the same with the county auditor, who shall present the same to the board of county commissioners at the next meeting of said board. If the board of county commissioners shall grant said petition by majority vote of all members elected to the board, then the amount of additional clerk hire requested in said petition shall thereupon become effective for said office. Said board shall act on any such petition within 60 days from the time it has been filed with the county auditor. If the board of county commissioners shall determine that the amount of additional clerk hire requested in said petition is excessive and more than is necessary for said office, it shall fix the amount of such additional clerk hire to be allowed, if any, and notify such officer thereof.",
