Technical assistance may include site visits, consultation with providers, or provider training.\nThe nursing homes may enter into shared services agreements according to section 246.57 to provide other services needed in the region that build on the services provided by the regional nursing homes and that are offered in conjunction with a community or community group.\nRespite care may be offered when space is available if payment for the cost of care is guaranteed by the person, the person's family or legal representative, or a source other than a direct state appropriation to the nursing home, and if the individual meets the facility's admission criteria.",
