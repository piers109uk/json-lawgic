	"text": "It is a goal of all area agencies on aging and caregiver support programs to support family caregivers of persons with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are living in the community by:\n(1) promoting caregiver support programs that serve Minnesotans in their homes and communities;\n(2) providing, within the limits of available funds, the caregiver support services that enable the family caregiver to access caregiver support programs in the most cost-effective and efficient manner; and\n(3) providing information, education, and training to respite caregivers and volunteers about caring for, managing, and coping with care for a person with ALS.\nThe Minnesota Board on Aging shall allocate the state funds that are received under this section for the caregiver support program. The board shall give priority to those areas where there is a high need of respite services as evidenced by the data provided by the board.\nFunds allocated under this section for caregiver support services must be used to reach family caregivers of persons with ALS and such funds may be used to provide services benefiting people under the age of 60 and their caregivers. The funds must be used to provide social, community-based services and activities that provide social interaction for participants. The funds may also be used to provide respite care.\nBy January 15, 2025, and every other January 15 thereafter, the Minnesota Board on Aging shall submit a progress report about the caregiver support grants in this section to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees and divisions with jurisdiction over human services. The progress report must include metrics of the use of the grant program.",
