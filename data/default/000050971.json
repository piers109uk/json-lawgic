	"text": "(a) An arbitrator is immune from civil liability to the same extent as a judge of a court in this state acting in a judicial capacity.\n(b) The immunity afforded by this section supplements any other immunity.\n(c) If an arbitrator does not make a disclosure required by section 572B.12, the nondisclosure does not cause a loss of immunity under this section.\n(d) In any judicial, administrative, or similar proceeding, an arbitrator is not competent to testify or required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, decision, or ruling occurring during the arbitration proceeding to the same extent as a judge of a court of this state acting in a judicial capacity. This subsection does not apply:\n(1) to the extent necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator against a party to the arbitration proceeding; or\n(2) if a party to the arbitration proceeding files a motion to vacate an award under section 572B.23, subsection (a)(1) or (2), and establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists.\n(e) If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator arising from the services of the arbitrator or if a person seeks to compel an arbitrator to testify in violation of subsection (d), and the court decides that the arbitrator is immune from civil liability or that the arbitrator is incompetent to testify, the court shall award to the arbitrator reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation.",
