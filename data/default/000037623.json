	"text": "The term \"kennel\" shall mean any establishment where dogs are kept for the purpose of breeding, sale or sporting purposes. Any person who keeps or operates a kennel may, in lieu of the license for each dog required by sections 347.08 to 347.21, apply to the town or city treasurer for a kennel license for the keeping or operating of such kennel. For such a kennel license the person shall pay a fee of $10 for the license year. With the kennel license the clerk shall issue a number of metal tags equal to the number of dogs kept in the kennel. The tags shall be made in a form so that they may be readily distinguishable from the individual license tags for the same year. The licensee of a kennel shall at all times keep one of such tags attached to the collar of each dog over six months old kept under a kennel license. The tags may be transferred from one dog to another within the kennel whenever any dog is removed from the kennel. The clerk may appoint a deputy or deputies to issue such licenses. The clerk shall receive ten cents for each license issued, to be paid by the town out of the revenue fund.\nA license shall be issued by the clerk or the clerk's deputy upon application being made therefor and upon payments made as herein provided. The license shall be in the form prescribed by the county auditor and shall be executed by the proper town, or city clerk or deputy. The license shall state the year for which it was issued, shall bear a serial number, the owner's name and address, and the name, sex, breed, and color of the dog licensed.",
