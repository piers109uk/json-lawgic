	"text": "Meetings of the board may be held from time to time as provided in the articles or bylaws at any place within or without the state that the board may select or by any means described in subdivision 2. If the board fails to select a place for a meeting, the meeting shall be held at the principal executive office, unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise. The board of directors may determine under subdivision 2 that a meeting of the board of directors shall be held solely by means of remote communication.\nMS 2000 [Paragraph (b) renumbered subd 3]\nAny meeting among directors may be conducted solely by one or more means of remote communication through which all of the directors may participate with each other during the meeting, if the same notice is given of the meeting required by subdivision 4, and if the number of directors participating in the meeting is sufficient to constitute a quorum at a meeting. Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes presence in person at the meeting.\nMS 2000 [Renumbered subd 4]\nA director may participate in a board meeting by means of conference telephone or, if authorized by the board, by such other means of remote communication, in each case through which the director, other directors so participating, and all directors physically present at the meeting may participate with each other during the meeting. Participation in a meeting by that means constitutes presence in person at the meeting.\nMS 2000 [Renumbered subd 5]\n(a) Unless the articles or bylaws provide for a different time period, a director may call a board meeting by giving at least ten days' notice or, in the case of organizational meetings pursuant to section 302A.171, subdivision 2, at least three days' notice, to all directors of the date, time, and place of the meeting. The notice need not state the purpose of the meeting unless the articles or bylaws require it.\n(b) Any notice to a director given under any provision of this chapter, the articles, or the bylaws by a form of electronic communication consented to by the director to whom the notice is given is effective when given. The notice is deemed given if by:\n(1) facsimile communication, when directed to a telephone number at which the director has consented to receive notice;\n(2) electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the director has consented to receive notice; and\n(3) any other form of electronic communication by which the director has consented to receive notice, when directed to the director.\n(c) Consent by a director to notice given by electronic communication may be given in writing or by authenticated electronic communication. Any consent so given may be relied upon until revoked by the director, provided that no revocation affects the validity of any notice given before receipt of revocation of the consent.\nMS 2000 [Renumbered subd 6]\nIf the day or date, time, and place of a board meeting have been provided in the articles or bylaws, or announced at a previous meeting of the board, no notice is required. Notice of an adjourned meeting need not be given other than by announcement at the meeting at which adjournment is taken.\nA director may waive notice of a meeting of the board. A waiver of notice by a director entitled to notice is effective whether given before, at, or after the meeting, and whether given in writing, orally, by authenticated electronic communication, or by attendance. Attendance by a director at a meeting is a waiver of notice of that meeting, except where the director objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened and does not participate thereafter in the meeting.",
