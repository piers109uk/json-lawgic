	"text": "The Interstate Compact for Juveniles is enacted into law and entered into with all other states legally joining in it in substantially the following form:\nARTICLE I\nPURPOSE\nThe compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in doing so have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, United States Code, title 4, section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.\nIt is the purpose of this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states to:\n(A) ensure that the adjudicated juveniles and status offenders subject to this compact are provided adequate supervision and services in the receiving state as ordered by the adjudicating judge or parole authority in the sending state;\n(B) ensure that the public safety interests of the citizens, including the victims of juvenile offenders, in both the sending and receiving states are adequately protected;\n(C) return juveniles who have run away, absconded, or escaped from supervision or control or have been accused of an offense to the state requesting their return;\n(D) make contracts for the cooperative institutionalization in public facilities in member states for delinquent youth needing special services;\n(E) provide for the effective tracking and supervision of juveniles;\n(F) equitably allocate the costs, benefits, and obligations of the compact states;\n(G) establish procedures to manage the movement between states of juvenile offenders released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, juvenile departments, or any other criminal or juvenile justice agency which has jurisdiction over juvenile offenders;\n(H) insure immediate notice to jurisdictions where defined juvenile offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines;\n(I) establish procedures to resolve pending charges (detainers) against juvenile offenders prior to transfer or release to the community under the terms of this compact;\n(J) establish a system of uniform data collection on information pertaining to juveniles subject to this compact that allows access by authorized juvenile justice and criminal justice officials, and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state; executive, judicial, and legislative branches; and juvenile criminal justice administrators;\n(K) monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of juveniles and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance;\n(L) coordinate training and education regarding the regulation of interstate movement of juveniles for officials involved in such activity; and\n(M) coordinate the implementation and operation of the compact with the Interstate Compact for the Placement of Children, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, and other compacts affecting juveniles particularly in those cases where concurrent or overlapping supervision issues arise.\nIt is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the Interstate Commission created herein are the information of public policies and therefore are public business. Furthermore, the compacting states shall cooperate and observe their individual and collective duties and responsibilities for the prompt return and acceptance of juveniles subject to the provisions of this compact. The provisions of this compact shall be reasonably and liberally construed to accomplish the purpose and policies of the compact.\nARTICLE II\nDEFINITIONS\nAs used in this compact, unless the context clearly requires a different construction:\nA. \"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the commission for its governance, or for directing or controlling its actions or conduct.\nB. \"Compact administrator\" means the individual in each compacting state appointed pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission, and policies adopted by the state council under this compact.\nC. \"Compacting state\" means any state which has enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\nD. \"Commissioner\" means the voting representative of each compacting state appointed pursuant to Article III of this compact.\nE. \"Court\" means any court having jurisdiction over delinquent, neglected, or dependent children.\nF. \"Deputy compact administrator\" means the individual, if any, in each compacting state appointed to act on behalf of a compact administrator pursuant to the terms of this compact responsible for the administration and management of the state's supervision and transfer of juveniles subject to the terms of this compact, the rules adopted by the Interstate Commission, and policies adopted by the state council under this compact.\nG. \"Interstate Commission\" means the Interstate Commission for Juveniles created by Article III of this compact.\nH. \"Juvenile\" means any person defined as a juvenile in any member state or by the rules of the Interstate Commission, including:\n(1) accused delinquent - a person charged with an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n(2) adjudicated delinquent - a person found to have committed an offense that, if committed by an adult, would be a criminal offense;\n(3) accused status offender - a person charged with an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult;\n(4) adjudicated status offender - a person found to have committed an offense that would not be a criminal offense if committed by an adult; and\n(5) nonoffender - a person in need of supervision who has not been accused or adjudicated a status offender or delinquent.\nI. \"Noncompacting state\" means any state which has not enacted the enabling legislation for this compact.\nJ. \"Probation\" or \"parole\" means any kind of supervision or conditional release of juveniles authorized under the laws of the compacting states.\nK. \"Rule\" means a written statement by the Interstate Commission promulgated pursuant to Article VI of this compact that is of general applicability, implements, interprets, or prescribes a policy or provision of the compact, or an organizational, procedural, or practice requirement of the commission, and has the force and effect of statutory law in a compacting state, and includes the amendment, repeal, or suspension of an existing rule.\nL. \"State\" means a state of the United States, the District of Columbia (or its designee), the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Northern Marianas.\nARTICLE III\nINTERSTATE COMMISSION FOR JUVENILES\nA.

The commission shall have all the responsibilities, powers, and duties set forth herein, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states in accordance with the terms of this compact.\nB. The Interstate Commission shall consist of commissioners appointed by the appropriate appointing authority in each state pursuant to the rules and requirements of each compacting state and in consultation with the State Advisory Council for Interstate Supervision of Juvenile Offenders and Runaways created hereunder. The commissioner shall be the compact administrator. The commissioner of corrections or the commissioner's designee shall serve as the compact administrator, who shall serve on the Interstate Commission in such capacity under or pursuant to the applicable law of the compacting state.\nC. In addition to the commissioners who are the voting representatives of each state, the Interstate Commission shall include individuals who are not commissioners but who are members of interested organizations. Such noncommissioner members must include a member of the national organizations of governors, legislators, state chief justices, attorneys general, Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision, Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, juvenile justice and juvenile corrections officials, and crime victims. All noncommissioner members of the Interstate Commission shall be ex-officio (nonvoting) members. The Interstate Commission may provide in its bylaws for such additional ex-officio (nonvoting) members, including members of other national organizations, in such numbers as shall be determined by the commission.\nD.

For purposes of this subsection, evidence is substantial if it would be considered substantial evidence under the Model (State) Administrative Procedures Act.\n5. If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule, those states may, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, cause that such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.\n6.

The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than 35 of the states. The initial effective date shall be the later of July 1, 2004, or upon enactment into law by the 35th jurisdiction. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state. The governors of nonmember states or their designees shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states and territories of the United States.\n3. The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the compacting states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the compacting states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the compacting states.\nARTICLE XI\nWITHDRAWAL, DEFAULT, TERMINATION,\nAND JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT\nSection A. Withdrawal.\n1. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state; provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact specifically repealing the statute, which enacted the compact into law.\n2. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.\n3. The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chair of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof.\n4. The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n5. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\nSection B. Technical assistance, fines, suspension, termination, and default.\n1. If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:\na. remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the Interstate Commission;\nb. alternative dispute resolution;\nc. fines, fees, and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the Interstate Commission;\nd. suspension or termination of membership in the compact, which shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the Interstate Commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the chief justice, or the chief judicial officer of the state; the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature; and the state council. The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws, or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission and of the default pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.\n2. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination.\n3. The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n4. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n5. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules.\nSection C. Judicial enforcement.\nThe Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\nSection D. Dissolution of compact.\n1. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state, which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.\n2. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\nARTICLE XII\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n1. The provisions of this compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this compact shall be enforceable.\n2. The provisions of this compact shall be liberally constructed to effectuate its purposes.\nARTICLE XIII\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\nSection A. Other laws.\n1. Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a compacting state that is not inconsistent with this compact.\n2. All compacting states' laws other than state constitutions and other interstate compacts conflicting with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\nSection B. Binding effect of the compact.\n1. All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the Interstate Commission, are binding upon the compacting state.\n2. All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the compacting states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n3. Upon the request of a party to a conflict over meaning or interpretation of Interstate Commission actions, and upon a majority vote of the compacting states, the Interstate Commission may issue advisory opinions regarding such meaning of interpretation.\n4. In the event any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by such provision upon the Interstate Commission shall be ineffective and such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency thereof to which such obligations, duties, powers, or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.",
