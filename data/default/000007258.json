	"title": "62B.05 TERM OF CREDIT INSURANCE.",
	"text": "The term of any credit life insurance, credit accident and health insurance, or credit involuntary unemployment insurance shall, subject to acceptance by the insurer, commence on the date when the debtor becomes obligated to the creditor, except that, where a group policy provides coverage with respect to existing obligations, the insurance on a debtor with respect to the indebtedness shall commence on the effective date of the policy. Where evidence of insurability is required and the evidence is furnished more than 30 days after the date when the debtor becomes obligated to the creditor, the term of the insurance may commence on the date on which the insurance company determines the evidence to be satisfactory, and in that event there shall be an appropriate refund or adjustment of any charge to the debtor for insurance. The term of the insurance shall not extend more than 15 days beyond the scheduled maturity date of the indebtedness except when extended without additional cost to the debtor.\nIf an indebtedness is prepaid in full before its scheduled maturity, except by performance of the insurer's obligation under the policy, the insurance shall be deemed canceled and a refund shall be paid or credited as provided in section 62B.08. Upon prepayment in full, the creditor shall make the refund of unearned premium, unless the credit insurance was originated by a third party, in which case the creditor shall promptly notify the third party who shall make the refund.",
