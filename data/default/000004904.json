All credit advanced pursuant to loan guaranty commitments is to be secured by subrogation of the state to mortgage security and other security interests granted to the private lender, in proportion to the amount advanced by the state. A board is established to investigate the feasibility of each project, its conformity to public policy and to environmental standards, the qualifications of the owners, operators, and lenders, and the nature and extent of the security, prior to commitment. The board shall also seek to secure financial participation by private persons not supported by the guaranty, to assure that in these respects each project satisfies and will continue to satisfy criteria which are adequate in the judgment of the board.",
