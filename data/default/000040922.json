Two ovals or similar target shapes, one above the other, must be put just below each question with the word \"yes\" beside the upper target shape and the word \"no\" beside the lower target shape.\nAn elector must vote separately on each question for the elector's vote to be counted on that question. To vote \"yes\" on a question, the elector shall fill in the oval or similar target shape beside the word \"yes\" just below the question. To vote \"no\" on a question, the elector shall fill in the oval or similar target shape beside the word \"no\" just below the question.\nThe polls must be open from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.\nIn all other matters the election must be run and the votes canvassed the way elections by ballot are run under sections 205.01 to 205.17.",
