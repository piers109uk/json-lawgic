	"text": "The Board of Regents may establish a branch campus of the University of Minnesota in Rochester, to serve the educational needs of and to foster the economic goals of the region and the state. The University of Minnesota should expand higher education offerings in Rochester that it is uniquely qualified to provide. To the extent possible, the Board of Regents should provide its offerings in partnership with higher education institutions that already serve Rochester and the southeastern region of Minnesota, and should avoid unnecessary duplicative offerings of courses and programs, particularly in nursing and allied health programs.\n[Repealed, 2006 c 282 art 8 s 10]\nThe legislature intends that the mission of the expanded education offerings in Rochester be congruent with the university's unique core mission of teaching, research, and outreach in order to support the educational needs and economic development of this region and the state. The legislature recognizes that the distinctiveness of each of the higher education institutions in Rochester must be maintained to achieve success in serving the higher education needs of the community and the economic goals of the state.\n[Repealed, 2006 c 282 art 8 s 10]",
