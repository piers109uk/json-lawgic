Where necessary to determine the facts, the services of other experts may also be employed.\nThe report of a physician, surgeon, or other expert requested under this section shall be filed with the compensation judge assigned to the matter if any. The report shall be made a part of the record of the case and be open to inspection as such.\nThe compensation judge shall fix the compensation of a physician, surgeon, or other expert whose services are employed under this section. This compensation shall be paid initially out of the funds appropriated for the maintenance of the Workers' Compensation Division, but shall be taxed as costs to either party, or both, or otherwise, as the compensation judge directs.\nWhere a sum which has been taxed to a party has not been paid, it may be collected in the same manner as are costs generally.",
