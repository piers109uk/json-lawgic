	"text": "(a) If a taxpayer is required to make payment of a tax to the commissioner by electronic means, the taxpayer shall make all payments of all taxes and fees paid to the commissioner by electronic means.\n(b) Paragraph (a) does not apply to payments required to be made for individual income taxes under section 289A.20, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), or 289A.25.\nIn addition to other applicable penalties imposed by law, after notification from the commissioner to the taxpayer that payments for a tax payable to the commissioner are required to be made by electronic means, and the payments are remitted by some other means, there is a penalty in the amount of five percent of each payment that should have been remitted electronically. After the commissioner's initial notification to the taxpayer that payments are required to be made by electronic means, the commissioner is not required to notify the taxpayer in subsequent periods if the initial notification specified the amount of tax liability at which a taxpayer is required to remit payments by electronic means. The penalty can be abated under the abatement procedures prescribed in section 270C.34 if the failure to remit the payment electronically is due to reasonable cause. The penalty bears interest at the rate specified in section 270C.40 from the date provided in section 270C.40, subdivision 3, to the date of payment of the penalty.",
