	"text": "The county board may grant a credit for taxes payable in the year following the year in which the damage or destruction occurred for: (1) homestead property that meets all the requirements under section 273.1233, subdivision 1, paragraph (a), but that does not qualify for a credit under section 273.1234, except that an application need only be submitted by the end of the year in which the damage occurred; and (2) nonhomestead and utility property that meets all the requirements under section 273.1233, subdivision 1, paragraph (b), except that an application need only be submitted by the end of the year in which the damage occurred.\nIn the case of a property located within a disaster or emergency area, the credit is equal to the difference between (i) the net tax on the property computed using the market value of the property established for the January 2 assessment in the year in which the damage occurred, and (ii) the net tax computed using the reassessed value. In the case of property not located in a disaster or emergency area, the credit under this section is equal to the result obtained by multiplying the difference in the net tax on the property computed using the market value of the property established for the January 2 assessment in the year in which the damage occurred, and the net tax computed using the reassessed value, times a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the assessment year that the structure was not usable and the denominator of which is 12. If a structure was usable for a fraction of a month, that month is not included in the numerator.\nThe county auditor shall certify the credits granted under this section for property within a disaster or emergency area to the commissioner of revenue for reimbursement to each taxing jurisdiction in which the damaged property is located. The commissioner shall make the payments to the taxing jurisdictions containing the property, other than school districts and the state, at the time distributions are made under section 473H.10, subdivision 3. Reimbursements to school districts shall be made as provided in section 273.1392. No reimbursement is to be made for credits to property not located in a disaster or emergency area.\nThere is annually appropriated from the general fund to the commissioner of revenue an amount necessary to make the payments required by this section.",
