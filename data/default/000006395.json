	"text": "The claim of a third party which is contingent only on that person first obtaining a judgment against the insured shall be considered and may be allowed as if there were no such contingency.\nAny claim that would have become absolute if there had been no termination of coverage under section 60B.22, and which was not covered by insurance acquired to replace the terminated coverage, shall be allowed as if the coverage had remained in effect, unless at least ten days before the insured event occurred either the claimant had actual notice of the termination or notice was mailed to the claimant as prescribed by section 60B.26, subdivision 1, or this chapter. If allowed the claim shall share in distributions under section 60B.44, subdivision 9.\nA claim may be allowed even if contingent, if it is filed in accordance with section 60B.37, subdivision 2. It may be allowed and may participate in all dividends declared after it is filed, to the extent that it does not prejudice the orderly administration of the liquidation.\nClaims that are due except for the passage of time shall be treated as absolute claims are treated, except that where justice requires the court may order them discounted at the legal rate of interest.\nThe rating bureau in carrying out its responsibilities may file a claim with the liquidator for all sums paid or to be paid by it.\nThe board of directors of the Insurance Guaranty Association may file a claim with the liquidator for all claims to which the association has been subrogated under section 60C.11, subdivision 1.",
