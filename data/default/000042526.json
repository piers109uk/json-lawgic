The budget estimates shall be read in full and the manager shall explain the various items thereof as fully as may be deemed necessary by the council. The annual budget finally agreed upon shall set forth in detail the complete financial plan of the city for the ensuing fiscal year for the funds budgeted and shall be signed by the majority of the council when adopted. It shall indicate the sums to be raised and from what sources and the sums to be spent and for what purposes according to the plan indicated in section 412.701.
