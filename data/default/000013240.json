	"text": "(a) A regulated entity may display at a facility a \"green star\" award designed by the commissioner if:\n(1) the regulated entity qualifies for participation in the environmental improvement program under section 114C.22;\n(2) the scope of the regulated entity's audit examines the facility's compliance with applicable environmental requirements;\n(3) the regulated entity certifies that all violations that were identified in the audit of the facility were corrected within 90 days or within the time specified in an approved performance schedule or certifies that no violations were identified in the audit; and\n(4) at least two years have elapsed since the final resolution of an enforcement action involving the regulated entity.\n(b) After consulting with each other, however, the commissioner or the county may issue an award if the enforcement action resulted from minor violations. If the regulated entity is located in a metropolitan county, the commissioner and the county must also consult with the Metropolitan Council before issuing a green star award.\n(c) The award may be displayed for a period of two years from the time that the commissioner determines that the requirements of this section have been met. A facility submitting findings from its environmental management system is not eligible to receive an award unless the findings are part of an audit which examines the facility's compliance with applicable environmental requirements.",
