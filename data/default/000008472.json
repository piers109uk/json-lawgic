	"text": "Any individual who believes such nonrenewal, cancellation or reduction in the limits of liability of coverage of the individual's policy is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise in violation of this provision, or who believes such notice of nonrenewal and the reason or reasons therefor were not given as provided herein, may, within 30 days after receipt of notice thereof, file in writing an objection to such action with the commissioner.\nUpon receipt of a written objection pursuant to the provisions herein, the commissioner may notify the insurer of receipt of such objection and of the right of the insurer to file a written response thereto within ten days of receipt of such notification. The commissioner may also order an investigation of the objection or complaint, the submission of additional information by the insured or the insurer about the action by the insurer or the objections of the insured, or such other procedure as the commissioner deems appropriate or necessary. Within 23 days of receipt of such written objection by an insured the commissioner shall approve or disapprove the insurer's action and shall notify the insured and insurer of the final decision. Either party may institute proceedings for judicial review of the commissioner's decision; provided, however, that the commissioner's final decision shall be binding pending judicial review.",
