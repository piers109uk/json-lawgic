	"text": "Any money received by the state from the Great Lakes protection fund, whether in the form of annual earnings or otherwise, must be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special Great Lakes protection account. Money in the account must be spent only as specifically appropriated by law for protecting water quality in the Great Lakes. Approved purposes include, but are not limited to, supplementing in a stable and predictable manner state and federal commitments to Great Lakes water quality programs by providing grants to finance projects that advance the goals of the regional Great Lakes toxic substances control agreement and the binational Great Lakes water quality agreement.\nThe legislature intends not to appropriate money from the Great Lakes protection account until projects have been reviewed and recommended by the Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources. A work plan must be prepared for each project for review by the commission. The commission must recommend specific projects to the legislature.",
