	"text": "(a) Nothing in sections 515A.1-101 to 515A.4-117 unless expressly stated diminishes the rights of holders of an interest as security for an obligation or prevents the declaration from requiring that all or a specified number or percentage of holders of an interest as security for an obligation affecting the units approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions, but no requirement for approval may operate to (1) deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by the unit owners, or (2) prevent the association from commencing, intervening in or settling any litigation or proceeding, or receiving and distributing any insurance proceeds pursuant to section 515A.3-112.\n(b) Foreclosure or enforcement of an interest as security for an obligation against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of an interest as security for an obligation against a portion of the condominium without redemption withdraws that portion from the condominium unless (i) the interest is recorded subsequent to the recording of the declaration or is otherwise subordinate to the declaration, or (ii) the holder or the holder's predecessor has issued a release or deed for a unit.",
