	"text": "(a) If the cost of authorized actions under section 115C.03 exceeds the amount appropriated to the agency for the actions and amounts awarded to the agency from the federal government, the agency may apply to the board for money to pay for the actions from the fund. The board shall pay the agency the cost of the proposed actions under section 115C.03 if the board finds that the conditions for the agency to be paid from the fund have been met, and that an adequate amount exists in the fund to pay for the corrective action. If the board pays the agency for the cost of authorized actions for which there is insurance coverage, the board is subrogated to the agency's rights with respect to the insurance, to the extent of the board's payment of costs for which insurance coverage exists, subject to the limitations on an agency cost recovery action set forth in section 115C.04, subdivision 3. The board may request the attorney general to bring an action in district court against the responsible person, the applicant, or the insurer to enforce the board's subrogation rights. Acceptance of a payment from the board by the agency constitutes an assignment to the board of the subrogation rights specified in this subdivision.\n(b) Money in the fund is appropriated to the board for the purpose of this subdivision.\nThe commissioner shall take actions needed to obtain federal funding to carry out the provisions of the Petroleum Tank Release Cleanup Act.",
