	"text": "The legislature finds that the services of volunteers are crucial to the effectiveness of public and private human services programs in the state. The legislature further finds that retired senior citizens are an excellent source of volunteer services, and that by recognizing and supporting retired senior volunteer programs the state will be serving the interests of human services as well as the interests of those senior citizens who participate in the volunteer programs.\nThe Board on Aging, with the cooperation of heads of other affected state agencies, shall provide staff and material support and shall make financial grants consistent with the purposes of subdivisions 1 to 4, to retired senior volunteer programs in the state. This support may include reimbursement of expenses incurred by program participants in the performance of their volunteer activities.\nThe board shall consult with the commissioner of human services, prior to expending money available for the retired senior volunteer programs. Expenditures shall be made (1) to strengthen and expand existing retired senior volunteer programs, and (2) to encourage the development of new programs in areas in the state where these programs do not exist. Grants shall be made consistent with applicable federal guidelines.\n[Repealed, 2014 c 262 art 4 s 9]",
