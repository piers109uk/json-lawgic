	"text": "(a) The off-highway vehicle damage account is created in the natural resources fund. Money in the off-highway vehicle damage account is appropriated to the commissioner of natural resources for the repair or restoration of property damaged by the illegal operation of off-highway vehicles or the operation of off-highway vehicles in an unpermitted area after August 1, 2003, and for the costs of administration for this section. Before the commissioner may make a payment from this account, the commissioner must determine whether the damage to the property was caused by the unpermitted or illegal use of off-highway vehicles, that the applicant has made reasonable efforts to identify the responsible individual and obtain payment from the individual, and that the applicant has made reasonable efforts to prevent reoccurrence.\n(b) Determinations of the commissioner under this section may be made by written order and are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14. Section 14.386 does not apply.\n(c) Money in the account is available until expended.",
