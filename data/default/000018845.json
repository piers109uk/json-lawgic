	"text": "(a) County agencies may develop on-the-job training programs for MFIP caregivers who are participating in employment and training services. A county agency that chooses to provide on-the-job training may make payments to employers for on-the-job training costs that, during the period of the training, must not exceed 50 percent of the wages paid by the employer to the participant. The payments are deemed to be in compensation for the extraordinary costs associated with training participants under this section and in compensation for the costs associated with the lower productivity of the participants during training.\n(b) Employers must compensate participants in on-the-job training at the same rates, including periodic increases, as similarly situated employees or trainees and in accordance with applicable law, but in no event less than the federal or applicable state minimum wage, whichever is higher.\n(a) County agencies shall limit the length of training based on the complexity of the job and the caregiver's previous experience and training. Placement in an on-the-job training position with an employer is for the purpose of training and employment with the same employer who has agreed to retain the person upon satisfactory completion of training.\n(b) Placement of any participant in an on-the-job training position must be compatible with the participant's assessment and employment plan under section 142G.56.",
