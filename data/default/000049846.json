	"text": "Until the court has confirmed an appointee under section 524.5-202, a minor who is the subject of an appointment by a parent and who has attained 14 years of age, the other parent, or a person other than a parent or guardian having custody or care of the minor may prevent or terminate the appointment at any time by filing in the court in which the appointing instrument is filed a written objection and by giving notice of the objection to the guardian and any other persons entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointment. An objection may be withdrawn, and if withdrawn is of no effect. An objection does not preclude an appointment of the appointee by the court. The court may treat the filing of an objection as a petition for the appointment of an emergency or a temporary guardian under section 524.5-204, and proceed accordingly.",
