	"text": "When under this chapter a taxpayer is permitted or required to make a return for a fractional part of a year, the tax shall be computed in the same manner as if such fractional part of a year were an entire year, except:\n(1) A taxpayer who is permitted to change the basis for reporting income from a fiscal to a calendar year shall make a separate return for the period between the close of the taxpayer's last fiscal year and the following December 31st; if the change is from a calendar to a fiscal year, a separate return shall be made for the period between the close of the taxpayer's last calendar year and the date designated as the close of the fiscal year; and if the change is from one fiscal year to another fiscal year, a separate return shall be made for the period between the close of the former fiscal year and the date designated as the close of the new fiscal year. The taxable net income, or for corporations the taxable net income as reduced by the deductions contained in section 290.21, for any such period shall be put on an annual basis by multiplying the amount thereof by 12 and dividing by the number of months included in the period for which such separate return is made; and the tax shall be that part of a tax, computed on the taxable net income put on such annual basis which the number of months in such period bears to 12 months.\n(2) Where any of the enumerated changes in accounting period referred to in clause (1) involve a 52-53 week fiscal year and any such change results in a short period of less than seven days, such short period shall be added to and deemed a part of the following taxable year. If the change results in a short period of seven or more days, but less than 359 days, the taxable net income, or for corporations the taxable net income as reduced by the deductions contained in section 290.21, for any such period shall be placed on an annual basis by multiplying such income by 365 and dividing the result by the same number of days in the short period; and the tax shall be that part of a tax, computed on the taxable net income placed on such annual basis which the number of days in such short period bears to 365 days. Where the short period is 359 days or more, the tax shall be computed in the same manner as if such short period were an entire year.",
