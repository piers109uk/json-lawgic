Qualified immunity, defense, and indemnification:\n(1) The members, officers, executive director, employees, and representatives of the commission shall be immune from suit and liability, either personally or in their official capacity, for any claim for damage to or loss of property or personal injury or other civil liability caused by or arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred, within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect any such person from suit and liability for any damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct of that person.\n(2) The commission shall defend any member, officer, executive director, employee, or representative of the commission in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the person against whom the claim is made had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit that person from retaining his or her own counsel; and provided further, that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from that person's intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct.\n(3) The commission shall indemnify and hold harmless any member, officer, executive director, employee, or representative of the commission for the amount of any settlement or judgment obtained against that person arising out of any actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such person had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of commission employment, duties, or responsibilities; provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from the intentional, willful, or wanton misconduct of that person.\nARTICLE XI\nRULEMAKING\nA. The commission shall exercise its rulemaking powers pursuant to the criteria set forth in this article and the rules adopted thereunder. Rules and amendments shall become binding as of the date specified in each rule or amendment.\nB. If a majority of the legislatures of the compact states rejects a rule, by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compact state.\nC. Rules or amendments to the rules shall be adopted at a regular or special meeting of the commission.\nD. Prior to promulgation and adoption of a final rule or rules by the commission, and at least 60 days in advance of the meeting at which the rule will be considered and voted upon, the commission shall file a notice of proposed rulemaking:\n(1) on the website of the commission; and\n(2) on the website of each compact state's psychology regulatory authority or the publication in which each state would otherwise publish proposed rules.\nE. The notice of proposed rulemaking shall include:\n(1) the proposed time, date, and location of the meeting in which the rule will be considered and voted upon;\n(2) the text of the proposed rule or amendment and the reason for the proposed rule;\n(3) a request for comments on the proposed rule from any interested person; and\n(4) the manner in which interested persons may submit notice to the commission of their intention to attend the public hearing and any written comments.\nF. Prior to adoption of a proposed rule, the commission shall allow persons to submit written data, facts, opinions, and arguments, which shall be made available to the public.\nG. The commission shall grant an opportunity for a public hearing before it adopts a rule or amendment if a hearing is requested by:\n(1) at least 25 persons who submit comments independently of each other;\n(2) a governmental subdivision or agency; or\n(3) a duly appointed person in an association that has at least 25 members.\nH. If a hearing is held on the proposed rule or amendment, the commission shall publish the place, time, and date of the scheduled public hearing.\n(1) All persons wishing to be heard at the hearing shall notify the executive director of the commission or other designated member in writing of their desire to appear and testify at the hearing not less than five business days before the scheduled date of the hearing.\n(2) Hearings shall be conducted in a manner providing each person who wishes to comment a fair and reasonable opportunity to comment orally or in writing.\n(3) No transcript of the hearing is required, unless a written request for a transcript is made, in which case the person requesting the transcript shall bear the cost of producing the transcript. A recording may be made in lieu of a transcript under the same terms and conditions as a transcript. This subsection shall not preclude the commission from making a transcript or recording of the hearing if it so chooses.\n(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a separate hearing on each rule. Rules may be grouped for the convenience of the commission at hearings required by this section.\nI. Following the scheduled hearing date, or by the close of business on the scheduled hearing date if the hearing was not held, the commission shall consider all written and oral comments received.\nJ. The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule.\nK. If no written notice of intent to attend the public hearing by interested parties is received, the commission may proceed with promulgation of the proposed rule without a public hearing.\nL. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures provided in the compact and in this section shall be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, in no event later than 90 days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to:\n(1) meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare;\n(2) prevent a loss of commission or compact state funds;\n(3) meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or rule; or\n(4) protect public health and safety.\nM. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in format, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions shall be posted on the website of the commission. The revision shall be subject to challenge by any person for a period of 30 days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge shall be made in writing, and delivered to the chair of the commission prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision will take effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission.\nARTICLE XII\nOVERSIGHT, DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AND ENFORCEMENT\nA. Oversight:\n(1) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each compact state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent.

Failure to provide service of process to the commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.\nB. Default, technical assistance, and termination:\n(1) If the commission determines that a compact state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall:\n(a) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other compact states of the nature of the default, the proposed means of remedying the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and\n(b) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n(2) If a state in default fails to remedy the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compact states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated on the effective date of termination. A remedy of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default.\n(3) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be submitted by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the compact states.\n(4) A compact state which has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations which extend beyond the effective date of termination.\n(5) The commission shall not bear any costs incurred by the state which is found to be in default or which has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state.\n(6) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices. The prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\nC. Dispute resolution:\n(1) Upon request by a compact state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact which arise among compact states and between compact and noncompact states.\n(2) The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes that arise before the commission.\nD. Enforcement:\n(1) The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact.\n(2) By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the state of Georgia or the federal district where the compact has its principal offices against a compact state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n(3) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the commission. The commission may pursue any other remedies available under federal or state law.\nARTICLE XIII\nDATE OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PSYCHOLOGY INTERJURISDICTIONAL COMPACT COMMISSION AND ASSOCIATED RULES, WITHDRAWAL, AND AMENDMENTS\nA. The compact shall come into effect on the date on which the compact is enacted into law in the seventh compact state. The provisions which become effective at that time shall be limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact.\nB. Any state which joins the compact subsequent to the commission's initial adoption of the rules shall be subject to the rules as they exist on the date on which the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule which has been previously adopted by the commission shall have the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state.\nC. Any compact state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same.\n(1) A compact state's withdrawal shall not take effect until six months after enactment of the repealing statute.\n(2) Withdrawal shall not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state's psychology regulatory authority to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this act prior to the effective date of withdrawal.\nD. Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to invalidate or prevent any psychology licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a compact state and a noncompact state which does not conflict with the provisions of this compact.\nE. This compact may be amended by the compact states. No amendment to this compact shall become effective and binding upon any compact state until it is enacted into the law of all compact states.\nARTICLE XIV\nCONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY\nThis compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes thereof. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state member thereto, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining compact states.\nARTICLE XV\nLIABILITY\n(Not Effective, 2021 c 27 s 2)",
