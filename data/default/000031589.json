If there are taxes delinquent, the auditor shall certify to the same; and upon payment of such taxes, or in case no taxes are delinquent, shall transfer the land upon the books of the auditor's office, and note upon the instrument, over official signature, the words, \"no delinquent taxes and transfer entered,\" or, if the land described has been sold or assigned to an actual purchaser for taxes, the words \"paid by sale of land described within;\" and, unless such statement is made upon such instrument, the county recorder or the registrar of titles shall refuse to receive or record the same; provided, that sheriff's or referees' certificates of sale on execution or foreclosure of a lien or mortgage, certificates of redemption from mortgage or lien foreclosure sales issued to the redeeming mortgagor or lienee, documents evidencing the termination of a contract for deed as described in section 559.213, deeds of distribution made by a personal representative in probate proceedings, transfer on death deeds under section 507.071, decrees and judgments, receivers receipts, patents, and copies of town or statutory city plats, in case the original plat filed in the office of the county recorder has been lost or destroyed, and the instruments releasing, removing and discharging reversionary and forfeiture provisions affecting title to land and instruments releasing, removing or discharging easement rights in land or building or other restrictions, may be recorded without such certificate; and, provided that instruments conveying land and, as appurtenant thereto an easement over adjacent tract or tracts of land, may be recorded without such certificate as to the land covered by such easement; and provided further, that any instrument granting an easement made in favor of any public utility or pipe line for conveying gas, liquids or solids in suspension, in the nature of a right-of-way over, along, across or under a tract of land may be recorded without such certificate as to the land covered by such easement.
