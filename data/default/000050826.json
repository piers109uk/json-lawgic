The order may also provide that, if delivery is not made or the location is not disclosed, the respondent or any other person specified in the order appear in court at a specified time and place to give testimony as to the location of the property and to show cause why an order should not be entered finding the respondent or other person specified in this section in contempt of court for failure to deliver the property or to disclose its location; and\n(3) provide that if the property, or any of it, is concealed in a building or elsewhere, and a public demand made by the sheriff for its delivery is refused or there is no response, the sheriff shall cause the building or enclosure to be broken open and shall take the property from it. The sheriff may not enter the residence of a person other than the respondent unless the order so specifies, identifying with particularity the residence or residences which may be entered, on the basis of a finding by the court that probable cause exists to believe that the property is at this residence.",
