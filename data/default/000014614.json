The money or property pledged and later received by the commissioner is immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the property or money or further act, and the lien of any pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the commissioner, whether or not those parties have notice of the lien or pledge.
