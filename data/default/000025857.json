	"text": "The district courts of the state of Minnesota have jurisdiction, subject to the provisions of the statutes and the rules of practice and procedure of the state of Minnesota relative to civil actions in the district courts, to restrain violations of sections 216D.01 to 216D.07, on petition by the attorney general on behalf of the state of Minnesota. When practicable, the commissioner shall give notice to a person against whom an action for injunctive relief is contemplated and afford the person an opportunity to present views and, except in the case of a knowing and willful violation, shall afford the person reasonable opportunity to achieve compliance. However, the failure to give the notice and afford an opportunity to present views does not preclude the granting of appropriate relief.\nActions under this section must be brought in district court in the district where the defendant's principal place of business in the state is located, and process in these cases may be served in any other district in the state of Minnesota where the defendant may be found or in which the defendant is an inhabitant or transacts business.",
