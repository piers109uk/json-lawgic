	"text": "Behavior analysts must limit practice to the client populations and services for which the behavior analysts have competence or for which the behavior analysts are developing competence.\nWhen a behavior analyst is developing competence in a service, method, or procedure, or is developing competence to treat a specific client population, the behavior analyst must obtain professional education, training, continuing education, consultation, supervision or experience, or a combination thereof, necessary to demonstrate competence.\nA behavior analyst must recognize the limitations to the scope of practice of applied behavior analysis. When the needs of a client appear to be outside the behavior analyst's scope of practice, the behavior analyst must inform the client that there may be other professional, technical, community, and administrative resources available to the client. A behavior analyst must assist with identifying resources when it is in the best interest of a client to be provided with alternative or complementary services.\nWhenever a complaint is submitted to the board involving a violation of this section, the burden of proof is on the behavior analyst to demonstrate that the elements of competence have been reasonably met.",
