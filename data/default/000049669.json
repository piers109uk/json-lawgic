No presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of death.\n(3) If a claim is presented under subsection (1), no proceeding thereon may be commenced more than two months after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim which is not presently due or which is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the two month period, or in any case, to avoid injustice the court, on petition, may order an extension of the two month period, but in no event shall the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.",
