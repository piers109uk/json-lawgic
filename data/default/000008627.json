If the converter dies from the injuries, survivors are not entitled to basic or optional economic loss benefits from any source other than an insurance contract under which the converter is a basic economic loss insured. For the purpose of this section, a person is not a converter if that person uses the motor vehicle in the good faith belief that the person is legally entitled to do so.",
