In case either fails to select an appraiser within the time provided, then a presiding judge of the district court of the county wherein the loss occurs may appoint such appraiser for such party upon application of the other party in writing by giving five days' notice thereof in writing to the party failing to appoint. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; and failing for 15 days to agree upon such umpire, then a presiding judge of the above mentioned court may appoint such an umpire upon application of party in writing by giving five days' notice thereof in writing to the other party. The appraisers shall then appraise the loss, stating separately actual value and loss to each item; and, failing to agree, shall submit their differences, only, to the umpire. An award in writing, so itemized, of any two when filed with this company shall determine the amount of actual value and loss. Each appraiser shall be paid by the selecting party, or the party for whom selected, and the expense of the appraisal and umpire shall be paid by the parties equally.\nIt shall be optional with this company to take all of the property at the agreed or appraised value, and also to repair, rebuild or replace the property destroyed or damaged with other of like kind and quality within a reasonable time, on giving notice of its intention so to do within 30 days after the receipt of the proof of loss herein required.\nThere can be no abandonment to this company of any property.\nThe amount of loss for which this company may be liable shall be payable 60 days after proof of loss, as herein provided, is received by this company and ascertainment of the loss is made either by agreement between the insured and this company expressed in writing or by the filing with this company of an award as herein provided. It is moreover understood that there can be no abandonment of the property insured to the company, and that the company will not in any case be liable for more than the sum insured, with interest thereon from the time when the loss shall become payable, as above provided.\nNo suit or action on this policy for the recovery of any claim shall be sustainable in any court of law or equity unless all the requirements of this policy have been complied with, and unless commenced within two years after inception of the loss.\nThis company is subrogated to, and may require from the insured an assignment of all right of recovery against any party for loss to the extent that payment therefor is made by this company; and the insurer may prosecute therefor in the name of the insured retaining such amount as the insurer has paid.\nAssignment of this policy shall not be valid except with the written consent of this company.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, this company has executed and attested these presents.\n(1) There shall be printed in the policy or an endorsement attached to the policy a printed form in the following words:\nWhen this policy has been issued to cover buildings used for residential purposes other than a hotel or motel and has been in effect for at least 60 days, or if it has been renewed, this policy shall not be canceled, except for one or more of the following reasons which shall be stated in the notice of cancellation:\n(a) Nonpayment of premium;\n(b) Misrepresentation or fraud made by or with the knowledge of the insured in obtaining the policy or in pursuing a claim thereunder;\n(c) An act or omission of the insured which materially increases the risk originally accepted;\n(d) Physical changes in the insured property which are not corrected or restored within a reasonable time after they occur and which result in the property becoming uninsurable; or\n(e) Nonpayment of dues to an association or organization, other than an insurance association or organization, where payment of dues is a prerequisite to obtaining or continuing the insurance.\nProvided, however, that this limitation on cancellation shall not apply to additional coverages in a divisible policy, other than a policy of fire and extended coverage insurance. If this company cancels the additional coverages, it may issue a new, separate fire policy at a premium calculated on a pro rata basis for the remaining period of the original policy.\n(2) The provisions of clause (1)(e) shall not be included in the language of the policy or endorsement unless the payment of dues to an association or organization, other than an insurance association or organization, is a prerequisite to obtaining or continuing the insurance.\nThis policy must not be rescinded or voided except where the insured has willfully and with intent to defraud concealed or misrepresented a material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject of this insurance or the interests of the insured in this insurance. This provision must not operate to defeat a claim by a third party or a minor child of the named insured for damage or loss for which the policy provides coverage.\n(a) In the event of a policy less than 60 days old that is declined, or a policy that it is being canceled for nonpayment of premium, the notice must be mailed to the insured at least 20 days before the effective cancellation date. If a policy is being declined or canceled for underwriting considerations, the insured must be informed of the source from which the information was received.\n(b) In the event of a midterm cancellation, for reasons listed in subdivision 3a, or according to policy provisions, notice must be mailed to the insured at least 30 days before the effective cancellation date.\n(c) In the event of a nonrenewal, notice must be mailed to the insured at least 60 days before the effective date of nonrenewal, containing the specific underwriting or other reason for the indicated actions.\n(d) This subdivision does not apply to commercial policies regulated under sections 60A.36 and 60A.37.\n(1) There may be printed in the policy or an endorsement attached to the policy, in case the assured desires liability to attach to several buildings, divisions or locations under one item, a printed form filed with and approved by the commissioner of commerce.\n(2) There may be printed in the policy or an endorsement attached to the policy, a printed form in the following words, to wit:\nThe insured has relinquished all rights to recover for loss or damage by fire from ..... (here insert name of individual, partnership, association or corporation).\n(3) There may be printed upon a policy issued in compliance herewith the words \"Minnesota standard fire insurance policy.\"\n(4) A company, if incorporated or formed in this state, may print in the policy any provisions which it is authorized or required by law to insert therein, if not incorporated in this state, it may, with the approval of the commissioner of commerce, print in the policy any provision required by its charter or deed of settlement, or by the laws of its own state or country, not contrary to the laws of this state.\n(5) Appropriate forms of other contracts or endorsements, whereby the property described in such policy shall be insured against one or more of the additional perils which the insurer is empowered to assume, and forms of provisions or endorsements which serve to modify the policy or premium in favor of the insured, may be attached to, used in or in connection with the Minnesota standard fire insurance policy when approved by the commissioner of commerce. Such forms of other contracts, provisions or endorsements attached to or printed thereon may contain provisions and stipulations inconsistent with the Minnesota standard fire insurance policy if applicable only to such other perils. There may be placed upon the Minnesota standard fire insurance policy, in such manner and form as is approved by the commissioner of commerce, such data as may be conveniently included for duplication on the daily reports for the office records of the company writing the policy.\n(6) A company may print or use on its policy, printed forms covering the maintenance or supervision of security guard's service, automatic sprinkler service or the maintenance of a clear space in lumber yards, when approved by the commissioner of commerce, but no such clause shall contain any provision calling for the lapse or the suspension of the insurance coverage.\n(7) A company may print or use in its policy printed forms for insurance against loss of rents and rental value, leasehold values, use and occupancy, and indirect or consequential loss or damage caused by change of temperature resulting from the destruction of refrigeration or cooling apparatus, or any of its connections.
