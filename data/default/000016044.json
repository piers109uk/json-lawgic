	"text": "Where two or more districts hereafter unite the state aid shall continue to be paid for the remainder of the school year in which the union was completed as the state aids were paid to the individual districts prior to the union.\nExcept as otherwise provided in law, every district that provides for the instruction of a pupil without a disability in a nonresident district shall pay to the nonresident district the actual cost of the instruction, excluding transportation costs. Tuition for a nonresident pupil with a disability must be determined according to section 125A.11.\nThe resident district shall also pay to the nonresident district, for capital expenditures and debt service, $10 per resident pupil unit in average daily membership for each nonresident pupil unit. However, a nonresident district may include in its tuition, for capital expenditures and debt service, an amount per resident pupil unit in average daily membership based on the amount that the average expenditure for capital expenditures and debt service determined by dividing such annual expenditure by the total number of pupil units in average daily membership in the district exceeds $10 per resident pupil unit. If the nonresident district has no capital expenditures or debt service, it may use the money for any purpose for which it is authorized to spend money.\nNotwithstanding subdivision 2, a resident district may pay a nonresident district the amount for tuition that is agreed upon by the districts.",
