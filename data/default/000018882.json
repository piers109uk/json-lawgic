	"text": "The commissioner of administration, after consulting with the commissioner of health, shall negotiate discounts or rebates on vaccine or may purchase vaccine at reduced prices. Vaccines may be offered for sale to medical care providers at the department's cost plus a fee for administrative costs. As a condition of receiving the vaccine at reduced cost, a medical care provider must agree to pass on the savings to patients. The commissioner of health may transfer money appropriated for other Department of Health programs to the commissioner of administration for the initial cost of purchasing vaccine, provided the money is repaid by the end of each state fiscal year and the commissioner of management and budget approves the transfer. Proceeds from the sale of vaccines to medical care providers, including fees collected for administrative costs, are appropriated to the commissioner of administration. If the commissioner of administration, in consultation with the commissioner of health, determines that a vaccine cost reduction program is not economically feasible or cost-effective, the commissioner may elect not to implement the program.",
