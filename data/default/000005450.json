The capital funds of a proposed bank shall not be less than a total amount which the commissioner considers necessary, having in mind the deposit potential for such a proposed bank and current banking industry standards of capital adequacy.\n(b) The directors of a state bank may issue shares of its unissued, authorized capital stock and may fix the amount of money or the actual value of the consideration for which the stock is issued.",
