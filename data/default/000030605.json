	"text": "If existence of the parent and child relationship is declared, or parentage or a duty of support has been acknowledged or adjudicated under sections 257.51 to 257.74 or under prior law, the obligation of the noncustodial parent may be enforced in the same or other proceedings by the custodial parent, the child, the public authority that has furnished or may furnish the reasonable expenses of pregnancy, confinement, education, support, or funeral, or by any other person, including a private agency, to the extent that person has furnished or is furnishing these expenses. Full faith and credit shall be given to a determination of paternity made by another state, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes.\nThe court may order support payments to be made to the custodial parent, the court administrator, or a person, corporation, or agency designated to administer them for the benefit of the child under the supervision of the court.\nWillful failure to obey the judgment or order of the court is a contempt of the court. All remedies for the enforcement of judgments apply including those available under chapters 518 and 518C.",
