	"text": "For the purpose of constructing, improving, maintaining, or operating any system, works, or facilities designed or used for any purpose under section 442A.17, a district, its officers, agents, employees, and contractors may enter, occupy, excavate, and otherwise operate in, upon, under, through, or along any public highway, including a state trunk highway, or any street, park, or other public grounds so far as necessary for such work, with the approval of the governing body or other authority in charge of the public property affected and on such terms as may be agreed upon with the governing body or authority respecting interference with public use, restoration of previous conditions, compensation for damages, and other pertinent matters. If an agreement cannot be reached after reasonable opportunity therefor, the district may acquire the necessary rights, easements, or other interests in the public property by condemnation, subject to all applicable provisions of law as in case of taking private property, upon condition that the court shall determine that there is paramount public necessity for the acquisition.\nA district may, upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the respective governing bodies or authorities concerned, provide for connecting with or using; lease; or acquire and take over any system, works, or facilities for any purpose under section 442A.17 belonging to any other governmental subdivision or other public agency.\nA district may, upon such terms as may be agreed upon with the respective governing bodies or authorities concerned, authorize the use by any other governmental subdivision or other public agency of any system, works, or facilities of the district constructed for any purpose under section 442A.17 so far as the capacity thereof is sufficient beyond the needs of the district. A district may extend any such system, works, or facilities and permit the use thereof by persons outside the district, so far as the capacity thereof is sufficient beyond the needs of the district, upon such terms as the board may prescribe.\nA district may be a party to a joint cooperative project, undertaking, or enterprise with one or more other governmental subdivisions or other public agencies for any purpose under section 442A.17 upon such terms as may be agreed upon between the governing bodies or authorities concerned. Without limiting the effect of the foregoing provision or any other provision of this chapter, a district, with respect to any of said purposes, may act under and be subject to section 471.59, or any other appropriate law providing for joint or cooperative action between governmental subdivisions or other public agencies.",
