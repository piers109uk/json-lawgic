A final adjournment shall discharge the jury. Before the verdict is recorded either party may require the jury to be polled, whereupon the court administrator shall ask if each juror's verdict is the same as the announced verdict. If any answer in the negative, the jury shall be sent out for further deliberation. If the verdict be defective in form or insufficient, it may be corrected under the advice of the court, or the jury may be again sent out.",
