	"text": "The specially equipped school bus standards contained in this section are required in addition to those required by section 169.4501. When a Minnesota standard contained in this section conflicts with a national standard adopted in section 169.4501, the Minnesota standard contained in this section is controlling.\nAll vehicles used to transport disabled students shall be equipped with a two-way communication system.\nSpecial restraining devices such as shoulder harnesses, lap belts, and chest restraint systems may be installed to the seats if the devices do not require the alteration in any form of the seat, seat cushion, framework, or related seat components. The restraints must be for the sole purpose of restraining students with disabilities.\nWheelchair securement devices must comply with all requirements for wheelchair securement systems contained in federal regulation in effect on the later of the date the bus was manufactured or the date that a wheelchair securement system was added to the bus.\nAll school buses equipped with a power lift shall provide at least a 12-inch aisle leading from wheelchair position to at least one emergency door and the lift area.\nThe securement and restraint system must be located and installed so that when an occupied wheelchair or other mobility aid is secured, the installation meets the requirements of the applicable federal motor vehicle safety standard.",
