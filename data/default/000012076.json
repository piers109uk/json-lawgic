If the hearing is adjourned the drainage authority shall require the auditor or, for a joint county drainage system, the auditors of affected counties to procure an option to acquire the needed right-of-way at an expense not exceeding the estimated cost specified in the detailed survey report. The order establishing the drainage project may not be made until the option is procured. If the option is procured and the drainage project established, the option shall be exercised and the cost of the right-of-way shall be paid as a part of the cost of the drainage project.",
