	"text": "An employer of workers on a farm operation or household workers not otherwise covered by this chapter may assume the liability for compensation imposed by this chapter and the employer's procurement of a workers' compensation policy constitutes an assumption by the employer of liability unless the employer elects in writing not to have those persons covered and the policy states that election. This assumption of liability takes effect and continues from the effective date of the policy and only as long as the policy remains in force. If during the life of the insurance policy, an employee, who is a worker on a farm operation or a household worker, suffers personal injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment, the exclusive remedy of the employee or the employee's dependents is under this chapter. For purposes of this section, farm worker does not include a spouse, parent, or child, regardless of age, of a farmer, a partner in a farm operation, or an officer of a family farm corporation as defined in section 500.24, subdivision 1, nor does it include other farmers in the same community or members of their family exchanging work with the farmer-employer or family farm corporation operator.\n[Repealed, 1984 c 432 art 1 s 4]\n[Repealed, 1984 c 432 art 1 s 4]\n[Repealed, 1984 c 432 art 1 s 4]",
