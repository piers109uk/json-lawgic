Such summons shall be subscribed by the judgment creditor, an agent or attorney, and shall describe the judgment, specify the amount due thereon, and require the party summoned to show cause within 20 days after the service thereof, and may be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. It shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the person subscribing it, to the effect that the judgment has not been paid or satisfied, except as specified in the summons, to the affiant's knowledge, information, or belief.",
