	"text": "It shall be the duty of the officials having charge of the penal institutions of the state or the release of prisoners therefrom to furnish to the bureau, as the superintendent may require, finger and thumb prints, photographs, distinctive physical mark identification data, other identification data, modus operandi reports, and criminal records of prisoners heretofore, now, or hereafter confined in such penal institutions, together with the period of their service and the time, terms, and conditions of their discharge. This duty to furnish information includes, but is not limited to, requests for fingerprints as the superintendent of the bureau deems necessary to maintain and ensure the accuracy of the bureau's criminal history files, to reduce the number of suspense files, or to comply with the mandates of section 299C.111 relating to the reduction of the number of suspense files where a disposition record is received that cannot be linked to an arrest record. The officials shall electronically enter the information in a bureau-managed searchable database within 24 hours of a prisoner's date of release or discharge. The bureau shall convert the information into an electronic format and enter it into the searchable database within three business days of the date of receipt, if the information is not entered by the officials.",
