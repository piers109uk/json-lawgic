An affidavit of the sheriff, the county auditor, or a person acting on behalf of the county auditor describing the premises and stating that the premises are vacant and unoccupied is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the affidavit. If the affidavit contains a legal description of the premises, the affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county recorder or the registrar of titles in the county where the premises are located.\n(a) The county auditor may take one or more of the following actions to protect the premises from waste or trespass:\n(1) install or change locks on doors and windows;\n(2) board windows; and\n(3) other actions to prevent or minimize damage to the premises from the elements, vandalism, trespass, or other illegal activities.\n(b) If the county auditor installs or changes locks on premises under paragraph (a), the county auditor must promptly deliver a key to the premises to the taxpayer or any person lawfully claiming a right of occupancy upon request.\nCosts incurred by the county auditor in protecting the premises from waste or trespass under this section may be added to the delinquent taxes due. The costs may bear interest to the extent provided, and interest may be added to the delinquent taxes due.\nThe actions authorized under this section are in addition to, and do not limit or replace, any other rights or remedies available to the county auditor under Minnesota law.",
