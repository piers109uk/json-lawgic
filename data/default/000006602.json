The commissioner shall determine those instances in which the party or parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest in an insurer will be required to file for and obtain approval of the transaction.\n(c) With respect to a transaction subject to this section, the acquiring person must also file a preacquisition notification with the commissioner, which must contain the information set forth in section 60D.18, subdivision 3, paragraph (b). A failure to file the notification may be subject to penalties specified in section 60D.18, subdivision 5.\n(d) For purposes of this section, a domestic insurer includes a person controlling a domestic insurer unless the person as determined by the commissioner is either directly or through its affiliates primarily engaged in business other than the business of insurance.

If a partner, member, or person is a corporation, or the person required to file the statement referred to in subdivision 1 is a corporation the commissioner may require that the information called for by paragraphs (a) to (n) be given with respect to the corporation, each officer and director of the corporation, and each person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than ten percent of the outstanding voting securities of the corporation.\nIf any material change occurs in the facts set forth in the statement filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer pursuant to this section, an amendment setting forth the change, together with copies of all documents and other material relevant to the change, must be filed with the commissioner and sent to the insurer within two business days after the person learns of the change.\nIf any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition referred to in subdivision 1 is proposed to be made by means of a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, or in circumstances requiring the disclosure of similar information under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or under a state law requiring similar registration or disclosure, the person required to file the statement referred to in subdivision 1 may utilize these documents in furnishing the information called for by that statement.\n(a) The commissioner shall approve any merger or other acquisition of control referred to in subdivision 1 unless, after a public hearing, the commissioner finds that:\n(1) after the change of control, the domestic insurer referred to in subdivision 1 would not be able to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license to write the line or lines of insurance for which it is presently licensed, unless the domestic insurer is in rehabilitation or other court-ordered supervision and the acquiring party commits to a plan that would enable the domestic insurer to satisfy the requirements for the issuance of a license within a reasonable amount of time;\n(2) the effect of the merger or other acquisition of control would be substantially to lessen competition in insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly therein in applying the competitive standard in this subdivision:\n(i) the informational requirements of section 60D.18, subdivision 3, paragraph (b), and the standards of section 60D.18, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), shall apply;\n(ii) the merger or other acquisition shall not be disapproved if the commissioner finds that any of the situations meeting the criteria provided by section 60D.18, subdivision 4, paragraph (c), exist; and\n(iii) the commissioner may condition the approval of the merger or other acquisition on the removal of the basis of disapproval within a specified period of time;\n(3) the financial condition of any acquiring party is such as might jeopardize the financial stability of the insurer, or prejudice the interest of its policyholders;\n(4) the plans or proposals that the acquiring party has to liquidate the insurer, sell its assets, or consolidate or merge it with any person, or to make any other material change in its business or corporate structure or management, are unfair and unreasonable to policyholders of the insurer and not in the public interest;\n(5) the competence, experience, and integrity of those persons who would control the operation of the insurer are such that it would not be in the interest of policyholders of the insurer and of the public to permit the merger or other acquisition of control; or\n(6) the acquisition is likely to be hazardous or prejudicial to the insurance buying public.\n(b) The public hearing referred to in paragraph (a) must be held 30 days after the statement required by subdivision 1 is filed, and at least 20 days' notice of it shall be given by the commissioner to the person filing the statement. Not less than seven days notice of the public hearing shall be given by the person filing the statement to the insurer and to other persons designated by the commissioner. The commissioner shall make a determination within 30 days after the conclusion of the hearing. At the hearing, the person filing the statement, the insurer, any person to whom notice of hearing was sent, and any other person whose interest may be affected by it may present evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and offer oral and written arguments and may conduct discovery proceedings in the same manner as is presently allowed in the district courts of this state. All discovery proceedings must be concluded not later than three days before the start of the public hearing.\n(c) If the proposed acquisition of control will require the approval of more than one commissioner, the public hearing referred to in paragraph (b) may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in subdivision 1. The person shall file the statement referred to in subdivision 1 with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) within five days of making the request for a public hearing. A commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant of the opt-out within ten days of the receipt of the statement referred to in subdivision 1. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis must be public and must be held within the United States before the commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A commissioner may attend the hearing, in person or by telecommunication. In this paragraph, the term \"commissioner\" when used in reference to an official from a state other than Minnesota means the state official charged with the responsibility of supervising the business of insurance in that state.\n(d) In connection with a change of control of a domestic insurer, any determination by the commissioner that the person acquiring control of the insurer shall be required to maintain or restore the capital of the insurer to the level required by the laws and regulations of this state shall be made not later than 60 days after the date of notification of the change in control submitted pursuant to section 60D.17, subdivision 1.\n(e) The commissioner may retain at the acquiring person's expense any attorneys, actuaries, accountants, and other experts not otherwise a part of the commissioner's staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist the commissioner in reviewing the proposed acquisition of control.\nThis section does not apply to:\n(1) Any transaction that is subject to section 60A.16, dealing with the merger or consolidation of two or more insurers.\n(2) Any offer, request, invitation, agreement, or acquisition that the commissioner by order exempts from this section as (i) not having been made or entered into for the purpose and not having the effect of changing or influencing the control of a domestic insurer, or (ii) as otherwise not comprehended within the purposes of this section.\nThe following are violations of this section:\n(1) the failure to file any statement, amendment, or other material required to be filed pursuant to subdivision 1 or 2; or\n(2) the effectuation or any attempt to effectuate an acquisition of control of, divestiture of, or merger with, a domestic insurer unless the commissioner has approved it.\nThe courts of this state have jurisdiction over every person not resident, domiciled, or authorized to do business in this state who files a statement with the commissioner under this section, and overall actions involving the person arising out of violations of this section, and the person is deemed to have performed acts equivalent to and constituting an appointment by the person of the commissioner to be the person's true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any action, suit, or proceeding arising out of violations of this section. Copies of all lawful process shall be served on the commissioner in compliance with section 45.028, subdivision 2.",
