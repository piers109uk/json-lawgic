	"text": "It is the commitment of the state to achieve universal health coverage for all Minnesotans by the year 2011. Universal coverage is achieved when:\n(1) every Minnesotan has access to a full range of quality health care services;\n(2) every Minnesotan is able to obtain affordable health coverage which pays for the full range of services, including preventive and primary care; and\n(3) every Minnesotan pays into the health care system according to that person's ability.\nIt is the goal of the state to make continuous progress toward reducing the number of Minnesotans who do not have health coverage so that by January 1, 2011, all Minnesota residents have access to affordable health care. The goal will be achieved by improving access to private health coverage through insurance reforms and market reforms, by making health coverage more affordable for low-income Minnesotans through purchasing pools and state subsidies, and by reducing the cost of health coverage through cost containment programs and methods of ensuring that all Minnesotans are paying into the system according to their ability.\n[Repealed, 1997 c 225 art 2 s 63]",
