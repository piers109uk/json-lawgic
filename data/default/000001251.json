Unless a greater penalty is specified elsewhere in law, a person who violates this paragraph is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.\n(b) A violation of paragraph (a) by a head of a department, or any state official, is cause for immediate removal of the official or head of a state department from the position held with the government of this state.
