	"text": "The property tax levied for any purpose under a special law that is not codified in Minnesota Statutes or a city charter provision and that is subject to a mill rate limitation imposed by the special law or city charter provision, excluding levies subject to mill rate limitations that use adjusted assessed values determined by the commissioner of revenue under section 124.2131, must not exceed the following amount for the years specified:\n(a) for taxes payable in 1988, the product of the applicable mill rate limitation imposed by special law or city charter provision multiplied by the total assessed valuation of all taxable property subject to the tax as adjusted by the provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1986, sections 272.64; 273.13, subdivision 7a; and 275.49;\n(b) for taxes payable in 1989, the product of (1) the property tax levy limitation for the taxes payable year 1988 determined under clause (a) multiplied by (2) an index for market valuation changes equal to the assessment year 1988 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to the tax divided by the assessment year 1987 total market valuation of all taxable property subject to the tax; and\n(c) for taxes payable in 1990 and subsequent years, the product of (1) the property tax levy limitation for the previous year determined pursuant to this subdivision multiplied by (2) an index for market valuation changes equal to the total market valuation of all taxable property subject to the tax for the current assessment year divided by the total market valuation of all taxable property subject to the tax for the previous assessment year.\nFor the purpose of determining the property tax levy limitation for the taxes payable year 2014 and subsequent years under this subdivision, \"total market valuation\" means the estimated market value of all taxable property subject to the tax as provided under section 273.032.\nA mill rate levy limitation imposed by a special law or city charter provision that is presently in effect, excluding those mill rate levy limitations that use adjusted assessed values determined by the commissioner of revenue under section 124.2131, shall be construed to allow no more and no less property taxes than the amount determined under this section.\nFor purposes of determining the mill rate limits applicable to county capital improvement programs under section 373.40, the mill rate limit applicable to the county must be divided by 0.45 and multiplied by the county's assessed value for taxes payable in 1988. The resulting dollar amount must be used in determining the limitation under the procedures provided by this section.",
