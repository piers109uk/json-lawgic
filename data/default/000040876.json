	"text": "If the city desires to construct an auditorium, the building may be included in the courthouse and city hall building if the county board agrees, an agreement is reached between the board and the city council on the cost of the addition to the courthouse and city hall building, and the entire amount of the additional cost is paid by the city. Nothing contained in this section shall require that the city must sell any existing auditorium building if an auditorium is constructed in the city hall and courthouse building. If the auditorium is included in the city hall and courthouse building, the auditorium shall not be managed by the joint building management committee of the city council and county board. The city shall manage the auditorium and shall pay for any additional expense in the care, upkeep, and maintenance of the courthouse and city hall building arising from the inclusion of the auditorium.\nA county board issuing and selling bonds to pay for acquiring land for constructing, equipping, and furnishing a joint courthouse and city hall building may appropriate and spend not more than $10,000 from the bond proceeds for equipping a municipal auditorium building located in a city of the first class located within the county, without reference to the courthouse and city hall building commission or other public body or bodies.\nIf, in the opinion of the city council and county board, it is inadvisable to provide meeting halls or quarters in the city hall and courthouse, for veteran organizations and their auxiliaries, and in the opinion of those bodies halls or quarters should be provided, the county board and city council may provide not more than $20,000 for improving halls or quarters in a municipally-owned auditorium building for the organizations and their auxiliaries out of the balances remaining in the funds referred to in Minnesota Statutes 1994, section 374.23. If the halls or quarters in a municipal auditorium are improved for the use of the organizations and their auxiliaries, the halls and quarters shall be under the sole control and management of the same persons or committees that manage the city hall and courthouse building. All costs of heating, lighting, and operating the halls or quarters shall be paid by the persons or committees. The persons or committees may direct the organizations and their auxiliaries to form a joint housing or other proper committee to represent and act for the organizations and their auxiliaries in all matters relating to the halls and quarters and to prepare and adopt rules and regulations setting the time, manner, and conditions under which the halls or quarters shall be used by the organizations and auxiliaries. If the joint housing or other committee is formed, any rules or regulations it adopts must be approved by the persons or committees having control and management of the halls or quarters before becoming effective.",
