The Metropolitan Council may prepare an estimate of the population and of the average household size for any other political subdivision located in the metropolitan area.\n(b) A governing body may challenge an estimate made under this section by filing its specific objections in writing with the Metropolitan Council by June 24. If the challenge does not result in an acceptable estimate, the governing body may have a special census conducted by the United States Bureau of the Census. The political subdivision must notify the Metropolitan Council on or before July 1 of its intent to have the special census conducted. The political subdivision must bear all costs of the special census. Results of the special census must be received by the Metropolitan Council by the next April 15 to be used in that year's June 1 estimate under this section.
