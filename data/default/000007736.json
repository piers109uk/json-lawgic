Health benefit plans that provide dependent coverage must define \"dependent\" no more restrictively than the definition provided in section 62L.02.\nHealth carriers may reimburse or pay for medical services, supplies, or articles provided under a small employer plan in accordance with the health carrier's provider contract requirements including, but not limited to, salaried arrangements, capitation, the payment of usual and customary charges, fee schedules, discounts from fee-for-service, per diems, diagnosis-related groups (DRGs), and other payment arrangements. Nothing in this chapter requires a health carrier to develop, implement, or change its provider contract requirements for a small employer plan. Coinsurance, deductibles, and out-of-pocket maximums must be calculated and determined in accordance with each health carrier's standard business practices.\n[Repealed, 2013 c 84 art 1 s 94]\n[Repealed, 2013 c 84 art 1 s 94]\n[Repealed, 2013 c 84 art 1 s 94]",
