	"text": "When a court sentences a person for a violation of sections 169A.20 to 169A.31 (impaired driving offenses), it shall inform the defendant of the statutory provisions that provide for enhancement of criminal penalties for repeat violators, and the provisions that provide for administrative plate impoundment and forfeiture of motor vehicles used to commit an impaired driving offense. The notice must describe the conduct and the time periods within which the conduct must occur in order to result in increased penalties, plate impoundment, or forfeiture. The failure of a court to provide this information to a defendant does not affect the future applicability of these enhanced penalties to that defendant.",
