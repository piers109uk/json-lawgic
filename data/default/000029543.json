	"text": "(a) It is the policy of this state that individuals or couples, either or both of whom participate in the medical assistance program, use their own assets to pay their share of the cost of their care during or after their enrollment in the program according to applicable federal law and the laws of this state. The following provisions apply:\n(1) subdivisions 1c to 1k shall not apply to claims arising under this section which are presented under section 525.313;\n(2) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k expanding the interests included in an estate for purposes of recovery under this section give effect to the provisions of United States Code, title 42, section 1396p, governing recoveries, but do not give rise to any express or implied liens in favor of any other parties not named in these provisions;\n(3) the continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property after the recipient's death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance under this section modifies common law principles holding that these interests terminate on the death of the holder;\n(4) all laws, rules, and regulations governing or involved with a recovery of medical assistance shall be liberally construed to accomplish their intended purposes;\n(5) a deceased recipient's life estate and joint tenancy interests continued under this section shall be owned by the remainderpersons or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear on the date of the recipient's death. They shall not be merged into the remainder interest or the interests of the surviving joint tenants by reason of ownership. They shall be subject to the provisions of this section. Any conveyance, transfer, sale, assignment, or encumbrance by a remainderperson, a surviving joint tenant, or their heirs, successors, and assigns shall be deemed to include all of their interest in the deceased recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest continued under this section; and\n(6) the provisions of subdivisions 1c to 1k continuing a recipient's joint tenancy interests in real property after the recipient's death do not apply to a homestead owned of record, on the date the recipient dies, by the recipient and the recipient's spouse as joint tenants with a right of survivorship. Homestead means the real property occupied by the surviving joint tenant spouse as their sole residence on the date the recipient dies and classified and taxed to the recipient and surviving joint tenant spouse as homestead property for property tax purposes in the calendar year in which the recipient dies. For purposes of this exemption, real property the recipient and their surviving joint tenant spouse purchase solely with the proceeds from the sale of their prior homestead, own of record as joint tenants, and qualify as homestead property under section 273.124 in the calendar year in which the recipient dies and prior to the recipient's death shall be deemed to be real property classified and taxed to the recipient and their surviving joint tenant spouse as homestead property in the calendar year in which the recipient dies. The surviving spouse, or any person with personal knowledge of the facts, may provide an affidavit describing the homestead property affected by this clause and stating facts showing compliance with this clause. The affidavit shall be prima facie evidence of the facts it states.\n(b) For purposes of this section, \"medical assistance\" includes the medical assistance program under this chapter, the general assistance medical care program formerly codified under chapter 256D, and alternative care for nonmedical assistance recipients under section 256B.0913.\n(c) For purposes of this section, \"medical assistance\" does not include Medicare cost-sharing benefits in accordance with United States Code, title 42, section 1396p.\n(d) All provisions in this subdivision, and subdivisions 1d, 1f, 1g, 1h, 1i, and 1j, related to the continuation of a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property after the recipient's death for the purpose of recovering medical assistance, are effective only for life estates and joint tenancy interests established on or after August 1, 2003. For purposes of this paragraph, medical assistance does not include alternative care.\n(a) If a person receives medical assistance hereunder, on the person's death, if single, or on the death of the survivor of a married couple, either or both of whom received medical assistance, or as otherwise provided for in this section, the amount paid for medical assistance as limited under subdivision 2 for the person and spouse shall be filed as a claim against the estate of the person or the estate of the surviving spouse in the court having jurisdiction to probate the estate or to issue a decree of descent according to sections 525.31 to 525.313.\n(b) For the purposes of this section, the person's estate must consist of:\n(1) the person's probate estate;\n(2) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in real property the person owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with a right of survivorship at the time of the person's death;\n(3) all of the person's interests or proceeds of those interests in securities the person owned in beneficiary form as provided under sections 524.6-301 to 524.6-311 at the time of the person's death, to the extent the interests or proceeds of those interests become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-307;\n(4) all of the person's interests in joint accounts, multiple-party accounts, and pay-on-death accounts, brokerage accounts, investment accounts, or the proceeds of those accounts, as provided under sections 524.6-201 to 524.6-214 at the time of the person's death to the extent the interests become part of the probate estate under section 524.6-207; and\n(5) assets conveyed to a survivor, heir, or assign of the person through survivorship, living trust, transfer-on-death of title or deed, or other arrangements.\n(c) For the purpose of this section and recovery in a surviving spouse's estate for medical assistance paid for a predeceased spouse, the estate must consist of all of the legal title and interests the deceased individual's predeceased spouse had in jointly owned or marital property at the time of the spouse's death, as defined in subdivision 2b, and the proceeds of those interests, that passed to the deceased individual or another individual, a survivor, an heir, or an assign of the predeceased spouse through a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, survivorship, life estate, living trust, or other arrangement. A deceased recipient who, at death, owned the property jointly with the surviving spouse shall have an interest in the entire property.\n(d) For the purpose of recovery in a single person's estate or the estate of a survivor of a married couple, \"other arrangement\" includes any other means by which title to all or any part of the jointly owned or marital property or interest passed from the predeceased spouse to another including, but not limited to, transfers between spouses which are permitted, prohibited, or penalized for purposes of medical assistance.\n(e) A claim shall be filed if medical assistance was rendered for either or both persons under one of the following circumstances:\n(1) the person resided in a medical institution for six months or longer, received services under this chapter, and, at the time of institutionalization or application for medical assistance, whichever is later, the person could not have reasonably been expected to be discharged and returned home, as certified in writing by the person's treating physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant. For purposes of this section only, a \"medical institution\" means a skilled nursing facility, intermediate care facility, intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities, nursing facility, or inpatient hospital;\n(2) the person received general assistance medical care services under the program formerly codified under chapter 256D; or\n(3) the person was 55 years of age or older and received medical assistance services that consisted of nursing facility services, home and community-based services, or related hospital and prescription drug benefits.\n(f) The claim shall be considered an expense of the last illness of the decedent for the purpose of section 524.3-805. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a state or county agency with a claim under this section must be a creditor under section 524.6-307. Any statute of limitations that purports to limit any county agency or the state agency, or both, to recover for medical assistance granted hereunder shall not apply to any claim made hereunder for reimbursement for any medical assistance granted hereunder. Notice of the claim shall be given to all heirs and devisees of the decedent, and to other persons with an ownership interest in the real property owned by the decedent at the time of the decedent's death, whose identity can be ascertained with reasonable diligence. The notice must include procedures and instructions for making an application for a hardship waiver under subdivision 5; time frames for submitting an application and determination; and information regarding appeal rights and procedures. Counties are entitled to one-half of the nonfederal share of medical assistance collections from estates that are directly attributable to county effort. Counties are entitled to ten percent of the collections for alternative care directly attributable to county effort.\n[Repealed, 2001 c 203 s 19]\n(a) A state agency with a claim or potential claim under this section may file a notice of potential claim under this subdivision anytime before or within one year after a medical assistance recipient dies. The claimant shall be the state agency. A notice filed prior to the recipient's death shall not take effect and shall not be effective as notice until the recipient dies. A notice filed after a recipient dies shall be effective from the time of filing.\n(b) The notice of claim shall be filed or recorded in the real estate records in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles for each county in which any part of the property is located. The recorder shall accept the notice for recording or filing. The registrar of titles shall accept the notice for filing if the recipient has a recorded interest in the property. The registrar of titles shall not carry forward to a new certificate of title any notice filed more than one year from the date of the recipient's death.\n(c) The notice must be dated, state the name of the claimant, the medical assistance recipient's name and last four digits of the Social Security number if filed before their death and their date of death if filed after they die, the name and date of death of any predeceased spouse of the medical assistance recipient for whom a claim may exist, a statement that the claimant may have a claim arising under this section, generally identify the recipient's interest in the property, contain a legal description for the property and whether it is abstract or registered property, a statement of when the notice becomes effective and the effect of the notice, be signed by an authorized representative of the state agency, and may include such other contents as the state agency may deem appropriate.\nFrom the time it takes effect, the notice shall be notice to remainderpersons, joint tenants, or to anyone else owning or acquiring an interest in or encumbrance against the property described in the notice that the medical assistance recipient's life estate, joint tenancy, or other interests in the real estate described in the notice:\n(1) shall, in the case of life estate and joint tenancy interests, continue to exist for purposes of this section, and be subject to liens and claims as provided in this section;\n(2) shall be subject to a lien in favor of the claimant effective upon the death of the recipient and dealt with as provided in this section;\n(3) may be included in the recipient's estate, as defined in this section; and\n(4) may be subject to administration and all other provisions of chapter 524 and may be sold, assigned, transferred, or encumbered free and clear of their interest or encumbrance to satisfy claims under this section.\n(a) The claimant may fully or partially release the notice and the lien arising out of the notice of record in the real estate records where the notice is filed or recorded at any time. The claimant may give a full or partial release to extinguish any life estates or joint tenancy interests which are or may be continued under this section or whose existence or nonexistence may create a cloud on the title to real property at any time whether or not a notice has been filed. The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the release for recording or filing. If the release is a partial release, it must include a legal description of the property being released.\n(b) At any time, the claimant may, at the claimant's discretion, wholly or partially release, subordinate, modify, or amend the recorded notice and the lien arising out of the notice.\n(a) The notice shall constitute a lien in favor of the Department of Human Services against the recipient's interests in the real estate it describes for a period of 20 years from the date of filing or the date of the recipient's death, whichever is later. Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, a recipient's life estate and joint tenancy interests shall not end upon the recipient's death but shall continue according to subdivisions 1h, 1i, and 1j. The amount of the lien shall be equal to the total amount of the claims that could be presented in the recipient's estate under this section.\n(b) If no estate has been opened for the deceased recipient, any holder of an interest in the property may apply to the lienholder for a statement of the amount of the lien or for a full or partial release of the lien. The application shall include the applicant's name, current mailing address, current home and work telephone numbers, and a description of their interest in the property, a legal description of the recipient's interest in the property, and the deceased recipient's name, date of birth, and last four digits of the Social Security number. The lienholder shall send the applicant by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written statement showing the amount of the lien, whether the lienholder is willing to release the lien and under what conditions, and inform them of the right to a hearing under section 256.045. The lienholder shall have the discretion to compromise and settle the lien upon any terms and conditions the lienholder deems appropriate.\n(c) Any holder of an interest in property subject to the lien has a right to request a hearing under section 256.045 to determine the validity, extent, or amount of the lien. The request must be in writing, and must include the names, current addresses, and home and business telephone numbers for all other parties holding an interest in the property. A request for a hearing by any holder of an interest in the property shall be deemed to be a request for a hearing by all parties owning interests in the property. Notice of the hearing shall be given to the lienholder, the party filing the appeal, and all of the other holders of interests in the property at the addresses listed in the appeal by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by ordinary mail. Any owner of an interest in the property to whom notice of the hearing is mailed shall be deemed to have waived any and all claims or defenses in respect to the lien unless they appear and assert any claims or defenses at the hearing.\n(d) If the claim the lien secures could be filed under subdivision 1h, the lienholder may collect, compromise, settle, or release the lien upon any terms and conditions it deems appropriate. If the claim the lien secures could be filed under subdivision 1i or 1j, the lien may be adjusted or enforced to the same extent had it been filed under subdivisions 1i and 1j, and the provisions of subdivisions 1i, clause (f), and 1j, clause (d), shall apply to voluntary payment, settlement, or satisfaction of the lien.\n(e) If no probate proceedings have been commenced for the recipient as of the date the lien holder executes a release of the lien on a recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, created for purposes of this section, the release shall terminate the life estate or joint tenancy interest created under this section as of the date it is recorded or filed to the extent of the release. If the claimant executes a release for purposes of extinguishing a life estate or a joint tenancy interest created under this section to remove a cloud on title to real property, the release shall have the effect of extinguishing any life estate or joint tenancy interests in the property it describes which may have been continued by reason of this section retroactive to the date of death of the deceased life tenant or joint tenant except as provided for in section 514.981, subdivision 6.\n(f) If the deceased recipient's estate is probated, a claim shall be filed under this section. The amount of the lien shall be limited to the amount of the claim as finally allowed. If the claim the lien secures is filed under subdivision 1h, the lien may be released in full after any allowance of the claim becomes final or according to any agreement to settle and satisfy the claim. The release shall release the lien but shall not extinguish or terminate the interest being released. If the claim the lien secures is filed under subdivision 1i or 1j, the lien shall be released after the lien under subdivision 1i or 1j is filed or recorded, or settled according to any agreement to settle and satisfy the claim. The release shall not extinguish or terminate the interest being released. If the claim is finally disallowed in full, the claimant shall release the claimant's lien at the claimant's expense.\nNotwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, if a claim is presented under this section, interests or the proceeds of interests in real property a decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant with a right of survivorship shall be part of the decedent's estate, subject to administration, and shall be dealt with as provided in this section.\n(a) For purposes of this section, paragraphs (b) to (j) apply if a person received medical assistance for which a claim may be filed under this section and died single, or the surviving spouse of the couple and was not survived by any of the persons described in subdivisions 3 and 4.\n(b) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, the person's life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985 on the date of the person's death shall not end upon the person's death and shall continue as provided in this subdivision. The life estate in the person's estate shall be that portion of the interest in the real property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy interest in real property in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest the person would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had they and the other owners held title to the property as tenants in common on the date the person died.\n(c) The court upon its own motion, or upon motion by the personal representative or any interested party, may enter an order directing the remainderpersons or surviving joint tenants and their spouses, if any, to sign all documents, take all actions, and otherwise fully cooperate with the personal representative and the court to liquidate the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interests in the estate and deliver the cash or the proceeds of those interests to the personal representative and provide for any legal and equitable sanctions as the court deems appropriate to enforce and carry out the order, including an award of reasonable attorney fees.\n(d) The personal representative may make, execute, and deliver any conveyances or other documents necessary to convey the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the estate that are necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash the decedent's interest or for any other purposes.\n(e) Subject to administration, all costs, including reasonable attorney fees, directly and immediately related to liquidating the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, shall be paid from the gross proceeds of the liquidation allocable to the decedent's interest and the net proceeds shall be turned over to the personal representative and applied to payment of the claim presented under this section.\n(f) The personal representative shall bring a motion in the district court in which the estate is being probated to compel the remainderpersons or surviving joint tenants to account for and deliver to the personal representative all or any part of the proceeds of any sale, mortgage, transfer, conveyance, or any disposition of real property allocable to the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest in the decedent's estate, and do everything necessary to liquidate and reduce to cash the decedent's interest and turn the proceeds of the sale or other disposition over to the personal representative. The court may grant any legal or equitable relief including, but not limited to, ordering a partition of real estate under chapter 558 necessary to make the value of the decedent's life estate or joint tenancy interest available to the estate for payment of a claim under this section.\n(g) Subject to administration, the personal representative shall use all of the cash or proceeds of interests to pay an allowable claim under this section. The remainderpersons or surviving joint tenants and their spouses, if any, may enter into a written agreement with the personal representative or the claimant to settle and satisfy obligations imposed at any time before or after a claim is filed.\n(h) The personal representative may, at their discretion, provide any or all of the other owners, remainderpersons, or surviving joint tenants with an affidavit terminating the decedent's estate's interest in real property the decedent owned as a life tenant or as a joint tenant with others, if the personal representative determines in good faith that neither the decedent nor any of the decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section, or if the personal representative has filed an affidavit with the court that the estate has other assets sufficient to pay a claim, as presented, or if there is a written agreement under paragraph (g), or if the claim, as allowed, has been paid in full or to the full extent of the assets the estate has available to pay it. The affidavit may be recorded in the office of the county recorder or filed in the Office of the Registrar of Titles for the county in which the real property is located. Except as provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when recorded or filed, the affidavit shall terminate the decedent's interest in real estate the decedent owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant with others. The affidavit shall:\n(1) be signed by the personal representative;\n(2) identify the decedent and the interest being terminated;\n(3) give recording information sufficient to identify the instrument that created the interest in real property being terminated;\n(4) legally describe the affected real property;\n(5) state that the personal representative has determined that neither the decedent nor any of the decedent's predeceased spouses received any medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section;\n(6) state that the decedent's estate has other assets sufficient to pay the claim, as presented, or that there is a written agreement between the personal representative and the claimant and the other owners or remainderpersons or other joint tenants to satisfy the obligations imposed under this subdivision; and\n(7) state that the affidavit is being given to terminate the estate's interest under this subdivision, and any other contents as may be appropriate.\nThe recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the affidavit for recording or filing. The affidavit shall be effective as provided in this section and shall constitute notice even if it does not include recording information sufficient to identify the instrument creating the interest it terminates. The affidavit shall be conclusive evidence of the stated facts.\n(i) The holder of a lien arising under subdivision 1c shall release the lien at the holder's expense against an interest terminated under paragraph (g) to the extent of the termination.\n(j) If a lien arising under subdivision 1c is not released under paragraph (i), prior to closing the estate, the personal representative shall deed the interest subject to the lien to the remainderpersons or surviving joint tenants as their interests may appear. Upon recording or filing, the deed shall work a merger of the recipient's life estate or joint tenancy interest, subject to the lien, into the remainder interest or interest the decedent and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent of the decedent's interest at the time of the decedent's death.\n(a) For purposes of this subdivision, the person's estate consists of the person's probate estate and all of the person's interests in real property the person owned as a life tenant or a joint tenant at the time of the person's death and the person's legal title or interest at the time of the person's death in real property transferred to a beneficiary under a transfer on death deed under section 507.071, or in the proceeds from the subsequent sale of the person's interest in the transferred real property.\n(b) Notwithstanding any law or rule to the contrary, this subdivision applies if a person received medical assistance for which a claim could be filed under this section but for the fact the person was survived by a spouse or by a person listed in subdivision 3, or if subdivision 4 applies to a claim arising under this section.\n(c) The person's life estate or joint tenancy interests in real property not subject to a medical assistance lien under sections 514.980 to 514.985 on the date of the person's death shall not end upon death and shall continue as provided in this subdivision. The life estate in the estate shall be the portion of the interest in the property subject to the life estate that is equal to the life estate percentage factor for the life estate as listed in the Life Estate Mortality Table of the health care program's manual for a person who was the age of the medical assistance recipient on the date of the person's death. The joint tenancy interest in the estate shall be equal to the fractional interest the medical assistance recipient would have owned in the jointly held interest in the property had they and the other owners held title to the property as tenants in common on the date the medical assistance recipient died.\n(d) The county agency shall file a claim in the estate under this section on behalf of the claimant who shall be the commissioner of human services, notwithstanding that the decedent is survived by a spouse or a person listed in subdivision 3. The claim, as allowed, shall not be paid by the estate and shall be disposed of as provided in this paragraph. The personal representative or the court shall make, execute, and deliver a lien in favor of the claimant on the decedent's interest in real property in the estate in the amount of the allowed claim on forms provided by the commissioner to the county agency filing the lien. The lien shall bear interest as provided under section 524.3-806, shall attach to the property it describes upon filing or recording, and shall remain a lien on the real property it describes for a period of 20 years from the date it is filed or recorded. The lien shall be a disposition of the claim sufficient to permit the estate to close.\n(e) The state or county agency shall file or record the lien in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles for each county in which any of the real property is located. The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the lien for filing or recording. All recording or filing fees shall be paid by the Department of Human Services. The recorder or registrar of titles shall mail the recorded lien to the Department of Human Services. The lien need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of recording or filing. Upon recording or filing of a lien against a life estate or a joint tenancy interest, the interest subject to the lien shall merge into the remainder interest or the interest the recipient and others owned jointly. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent of the decedent's interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death as determined under this section.\n(f) The department shall make no adjustment or recovery under the lien until after the decedent's spouse, if any, has died, and only at a time when the decedent has no surviving child described in subdivision 3. The estate, any owner of an interest in the property which is or may be subject to the lien, or any other interested party, may voluntarily pay off, settle, or otherwise satisfy the claim secured or to be secured by the lien at any time before or after the lien is filed or recorded. Such payoffs, settlements, and satisfactions shall be deemed to be voluntary repayments of past medical assistance payments for the benefit of the deceased recipient, and neither the process of settling the claim, the payment of the claim, or the acceptance of a payment shall constitute an adjustment or recovery that is prohibited under this subdivision.\n(g) The lien under this subdivision may be enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the enforcement of judgment liens against real estate or by a foreclosure by action under chapter 581. When the lien is paid, satisfied, or otherwise discharged, the state or county agency shall prepare and file a release of lien at its own expense. No action to foreclose the lien shall be commenced unless the lienholder has first given 30 days' prior written notice to pay the lien to the owners and parties in possession of the property subject to the lien. The notice shall:\n(1) include the name, address, and telephone number of the lienholder;\n(2) describe the lien;\n(3) give the amount of the lien;\n(4) inform the owner or party in possession that payment of the lien in full must be made to the lienholder within 30 days after service of the notice or the lienholder may begin proceedings to foreclose the lien; and\n(5) be served by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested, ordinary first class mail, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which any part of the property is located. Service of the notice shall be complete upon mailing or publication.\nFor purposes of this subdivision, the provisions in subdivision 1i, paragraphs (a) to (c) apply.\n(a) If payment of a claim filed under this section is limited as provided in subdivision 4, and if the estate does not have other assets sufficient to pay the claim in full, as allowed, the personal representative or the court shall make, execute, and deliver a lien on the property in the estate that is exempt from the claim under subdivision 4 in favor of the commissioner of human services on forms provided by the commissioner to the county agency filing the claim. If the estate pays a claim filed under this section in full from other assets of the estate, no lien shall be filed against the property described in subdivision 4.\n(b) The lien shall be in an amount equal to the unpaid balance of the allowed claim under this section remaining after the estate has applied all other available assets of the estate to pay the claim. The property exempt under subdivision 4 shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, encumbered, or distributed until after the personal representative has determined the estate has other assets sufficient to pay the allowed claim in full, or until after the lien has been filed or recorded. The lien shall bear interest as provided under section 524.3-806, shall attach to the property it describes upon filing or recording, and shall remain a lien on the real property it describes for a period of 20 years from the date it is filed or recorded. The lien shall be a disposition of the claim sufficient to permit the estate to close.\n(c) The state or county agency shall file or record the lien in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles in each county in which any of the real property is located. The department shall pay the filing fees. The lien need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of recording or filing. The recorder or registrar of titles shall accept the lien for filing or recording.\n(d) The commissioner shall make no adjustment or recovery under the lien until none of the persons listed in subdivision 4 are residing on the property or until the property is sold or transferred. The estate or any owner of an interest in the property that is or may be subject to the lien, or any other interested party, may voluntarily pay off, settle, or otherwise satisfy the claim secured or to be secured by the lien at any time before or after the lien is filed or recorded. The payoffs, settlements, and satisfactions shall be deemed to be voluntary repayments of past medical assistance payments for the benefit of the deceased recipient and neither the process of settling the claim, the payment of the claim, or acceptance of a payment shall constitute an adjustment or recovery that is prohibited under this subdivision.\n(e) A lien under this subdivision may be enforced or foreclosed in the manner provided for by law for the enforcement of judgment liens against real estate or by a foreclosure by action under chapter 581. When the lien has been paid, satisfied, or otherwise discharged, the claimant shall prepare and file a release of lien at the claimant's expense. No action to foreclose the lien shall be commenced unless the lienholder has first given 30 days prior written notice to pay the lien to the record owners of the property and the parties in possession of the property subject to the lien. The notice shall:\n(1) include the name, address, and telephone number of the lienholder;\n(2) describe the lien;\n(3) give the amount of the lien;\n(4) inform the owner or party in possession that payment of the lien in full must be made to the lienholder within 30 days after service of the notice or the lienholder may begin proceedings to foreclose the lien; and\n(5) be served by personal service, certified mail, return receipt requested, ordinary first class mail, or by publishing it once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which any part of the property is located. Service shall be complete upon mailing or publication.\n(f) Upon filing or recording of a lien against a life estate or joint tenancy interest under this subdivision, the interest subject to the lien shall merge into the remainder interest or the interest the decedent and others owned jointly, effective on the date of recording and filing. The lien shall attach to and run with the property to the extent of the decedent's interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death as determined under this section.\n(g)(1) An affidavit may be provided by a personal representative, at their discretion, stating the personal representative has determined in good faith that a decedent survived by a spouse or a person listed in subdivision 3, or by a person listed in subdivision 4, or the decedent's predeceased spouse did not receive any medical assistance giving rise to a claim under this section, or that the real property described in subdivision 4 is not needed to pay in full a claim arising under this section.\n(2) The affidavit shall:\n(i) describe the property and the interest being extinguished;\n(ii) name the decedent and give the date of death;\n(iii) state the facts listed in clause (1);\n(iv) state that the affidavit is being filed to terminate the life estate or joint tenancy interest created under this subdivision;\n(v) be signed by the personal representative; and\n(vi) contain any other information that the affiant deems appropriate.\n(3) Except as provided in section 514.981, subdivision 6, when the affidavit is filed or recorded, the life estate or joint tenancy interest in real property that the affidavit describes shall be terminated effective as of the date of filing or recording. The termination shall be final and may not be set aside for any reason.\nAny notice, lien, release, or other document filed under subdivisions 1c to 1k, and any lien, release of lien, or other documents relating to a lien filed under subdivisions 1h, 1i, and 1j must be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, in the county where the affected real property is located. Notwithstanding section 386.77, the state or county agency shall pay any applicable filing fee. An attestation, certification, or acknowledgment is not required as a condition of filing. If the property described in the filing is registered property, the registrar of titles shall record the filing on the certificate of title for each parcel of property described in the filing. If the property described in the filing is abstract property, the recorder shall file and index the property in the county's grantor-grantee indexes and any tract indexes the county maintains for each parcel of property described in the filing. The recorder or registrar of titles shall return the filed document to the party filing it at no cost. If the party making the filing provides a duplicate copy of the filing, the recorder or registrar of titles shall show the recording or filing data on the copy and return it to the party at no extra cost.\n(a) The claim shall include only:\n(1) the amount of medical assistance rendered to recipients 55 years of age or older that consisted of nursing facility services, home and community-based services, and related hospital and prescription drug services;\n(2) the total amount of medical assistance rendered during a period of institutionalization described in subdivision 1a, paragraph (e), clause (1); and\n(3) the total amount of general assistance medical care rendered under the program formerly codified under chapter 256D.\nThe claim shall not include interest. For the purposes of this section, \"home and community-based services\" has the same meaning it has when used in United States Code, title 42, section 1396p(b)(1)(B)(i), and includes the alternative care program under section 256B.0913, even for periods when alternative care services receive only state funding.\n(b) Claims that have been allowed but not paid shall bear interest according to section 524.3-806, paragraph (d). A claim against the estate of a surviving spouse who did not receive medical assistance, for medical assistance rendered for the predeceased spouse, shall be payable from the full value of all of the predeceased spouse's assets and interests which are part of the surviving spouse's estate under subdivisions 1a and 2b. Recovery of medical assistance expenses in the nonrecipient surviving spouse's estate is limited to the value of the assets of the estate that were marital property or jointly owned property at any time during the marriage. The claim is not payable from the value of assets or proceeds of assets in the estate attributable to a predeceased spouse whom the individual married after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse for whom the claim is filed or from assets and the proceeds of assets in the estate which the nonrecipient decedent spouse acquired with assets which were not marital property or jointly owned property after the death of the predeceased recipient spouse. Claims for alternative care shall be net of all premiums paid under section 256B.0913, subdivision 12, on or after July 1, 2003, and shall be limited to services provided on or after July 1, 2003. Claims against marital property shall be limited to claims against recipients who died on or after July 1, 2009.\n[Repealed, 2001 c 203 s 19]\n(a) For purposes of this subdivision and subdivisions 1a and 2, paragraphs (b) to (d) apply.\n(b) At the time of death of a recipient spouse and solely for purpose of recovery of medical assistance benefits received, a predeceased recipient spouse shall have a legal title or interest in the undivided whole of all of the property which the recipient and the recipient's surviving spouse owned jointly or which was marital property at any time during their marriage regardless of the form of ownership and regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both the recipient and the recipient's spouse. Title and interest in the property of a predeceased recipient spouse shall not end or extinguish upon the person's death and shall continue for the purpose of allowing recovery of medical assistance in the estate of the surviving spouse. Upon the death of the predeceased recipient spouse, title and interest in the predeceased spouse's property shall vest in the surviving spouse by operation of law and without the necessity for any probate or decree of descent proceedings and shall continue to exist after the death of the predeceased spouse and the surviving spouse to permit recovery of medical assistance. The recipient spouse and the surviving spouse of a deceased recipient spouse shall not encumber, disclaim, transfer, alienate, hypothecate, or otherwise divest themselves of these interests before or upon death.\n(c) For purposes of this section, \"marital property\" includes any and all real or personal property of any kind or interests in such property the predeceased recipient spouse and their spouse, or either of them, owned at the time of their marriage to each other or acquired during their marriage regardless of whether it was owned or titled in the names of one or both of them. If either or both spouses of a married couple received medical assistance, all property owned during the marriage or which either or both spouses acquired during their marriage shall be presumed to be marital property for purposes of recovering medical assistance unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.\n(d) The agency responsible for the claim for medical assistance for a recipient spouse may, at its discretion, release specific real and personal property from the provisions of this section. The release shall extinguish the interest created under paragraph (b) in the land it describes upon filing or recording. The release need not be attested, certified, or acknowledged as a condition of filing or recording and shall be filed or recorded in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles, as appropriate, in the county where the real property is located. The party to whom the release is given shall be responsible for paying all fees and costs necessary to record and file the release. If the property described in the release is registered property, the registrar of titles shall accept it for recording and shall record it on the certificate of title for each parcel of property described in the release. If the property described in the release is abstract property, the recorder shall accept it for filing and file it in the county's grantor-grantee indexes and any tract index the county maintains for each parcel of property described in the release.\nIf a decedent is survived by a spouse, or was single or the surviving spouse of a married couple and is survived by a child who is under age 21 or blind or permanently and totally disabled according to the Supplemental Security Income program criteria, a claim shall be filed against the estate according to this section.\n(a) If the decedent who was single or the surviving spouse of a married couple is survived by one of the following persons, a claim exists against the estate payable first from the value of the nonhomestead property included in the estate and the personal representative shall make, execute, and deliver to the county agency a lien against the homestead property in the estate for any unpaid balance of the claim to the claimant as provided under this section:\n(1) a sibling who resided in the decedent medical assistance recipient's home at least one year before the decedent's institutionalization and continuously since the date of institutionalization; or\n(2) a son or daughter or a grandchild who resided in the decedent medical assistance recipient's home for at least two years immediately before the parent's or grandparent's institutionalization and continuously since the date of institutionalization, and who establishes by a preponderance of the evidence having provided care to the parent or grandparent who received medical assistance, that the care was provided before institutionalization, and that the care permitted the parent or grandparent to reside at home rather than in an institution.\n(b) For purposes of this subdivision, \"institutionalization\" means receiving care:\n(1) in a nursing facility or swing bed, or intermediate care facility for persons with developmental disabilities; or\n(2) through home and community-based services under chapter 256S or section 256B.092 or 256B.49.\n(a) Any person entitled to notice in subdivision 1a has a right to apply for waiver of the claim based upon undue hardship. Any claim pursuant to this section may be fully or partially waived because of undue hardship. Undue hardship does not include action taken by the decedent which divested or diverted assets in order to avoid estate recovery. Any waiver of a claim must benefit the person claiming undue hardship. The commissioner shall have authority to hear claimant appeals, pursuant to section 256.045, when an application for a hardship waiver is denied in whole or part.\n(b) Upon approval of a hardship waiver, this paragraph applies to a claim against the decedent's real property if an individual other than the recipient's spouse had an ownership interest in the property at the time of the decedent's death and actually and continuously occupied the real property as the individual's residence for at least 180 days before the date the decedent died. If the real property is classified as the individual's homestead property for property tax purposes under section 273.124, no adjustment or recovery may be made until the individual no longer resides in the property or until the property is sold or transferred.\nFor purposes of subdivision 1 and section 514.981, subdivision 6, a life estate or joint tenancy interest is established upon the earlier of:\n(1) the date the instrument creating the interest is recorded or filed in the office of the county recorder or registrar of titles where the real estate interest it describes is located;\n(2) the date of delivery by the grantor to the grantee of the signed instrument as stated in an affidavit made by a person with knowledge of the facts;\n(3) the date on which the judicial order creating the interest was issued by the court; or\n(4) the date upon which the interest devolves under section 524.3-101.\nMedical assistance liens and liens under notices of potential claims that are of record against life estate or joint tenancy interests established prior to August 1, 2003, shall end, become unenforceable, and cease to be liens on those interests upon the death of the person named in the lien or notice of potential claim, shall be disregarded by examiners of title after the death of the life tenant or joint tenant, and shall not be carried forward to a subsequent certificate of title. This subdivision shall not apply to life estates that continue to exist after the death of the person named in the lien or notice of potential claim under the terms of the instrument creating or reserving the life estate until the life estate ends as provided for in the instrument.\nThe commissioner of human services, county agencies, and elected officials and their employees are immune from all liability for any action taken implementing Laws 2003, First Special Session chapter 14, article 12, sections 40 to 52 and 90, as those laws existed at the time the action was taken, and section 514.981, subdivision 6.\nThe commissioner shall be permitted to intervene as a party in any proceeding involving recovery of medical assistance upon filing a notice of intervention and serving such notice on the other parties.",
