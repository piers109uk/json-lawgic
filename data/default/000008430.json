Information regarding moving traffic violations or motor vehicle accidents must be specifically requested on the application in order for a company to use those incidents to exercise its right to cancel within the first 59 days of coverage. When nonpayment of premiums is the reason for cancellation, the reason must be given to the insured with the notice of cancellation; and if the company is exercising its right to cancel within the first 59 days of coverage and notice is given with less than ten days remaining in the 59-day period, the coverage must be extended, to expire ten days after notice was mailed.",
