Each year, this restriction shall be reexamined by the commissioner of employment and economic development, and a public hearing shall be held by the commissioner of employment and economic development to determine whether administrative or interpretive difficulties or unsatisfactory progress in the provision of low-rent housing or redevelopment require a modification of that income restriction. Upon the conclusion of that hearing, the commissioner shall modify the restriction set out in this section to the extent required to make satisfactory progress in the provision of low-rent housing or redevelopment.",
