	"text": "The commissioner of natural resources must classify all public and private lands in the state by the use to which the lands are adapted, but principally as to adaptability to present known uses, such as agriculture and forestry. This classification must be based on consideration of the known physical and economic factors affecting use of the land. The commissioner must consult private, state, and federal agencies concerned with land use. The classification must be done first in the counties having land classification committees. In determining the land classification, the commissioner must consult and cooperate with the land classification committee. The determination of the land classification committee is final.",
