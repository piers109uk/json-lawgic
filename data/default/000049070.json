	"text": "(a) Express warranties made by a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant to a purchaser of a unit, if reasonably relied upon by the purchaser, are created as follows:\n(1) Any affirmation of fact or promise which relates to the unit; use of the unit; rights appurtenant to the unit; improvements to the common interest community that would directly benefit the purchaser or the unit; or the right to use or have the benefit of facilities which are not a part of the common interest community, creates an express warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will conform to the affirmation or promise.\n(2) Any model or description of the physical characteristics of a unit or the common interest community, including plans and specifications of or for a unit or other improvements located in the common interest community, creates an express warranty that the unit and the common interest community will conform to the model or description. A notice prominently displayed on a model or included in a description shall prevent a purchaser from reasonably relying upon the model or description to the extent of the disclaimer set forth in the notice.\n(3) Any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the common interest community, including plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the common interest community will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerances.\n(b) Neither the form of the word \"warranty\" or \"guaranty,\" nor a specific intention to make a warranty, are necessary to create an express warranty of quality, but a statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty.\n(c) Any conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties.",
