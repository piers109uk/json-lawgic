	"text": "The commissioner of commerce may make examinations of the collection records of a licensee or registered individual collector at a reasonable time and in a scope as is necessary to enforce the provisions of sections 332.31 to 332.44, and for that purpose the commissioner shall have free access to the books and records of a licensee or registered individual collector relating thereto. If a licensee or registered individual collector violates any provision of sections 332.31 to 332.44, or any administrative rules issued pursuant to sections 332.31 to 332.44, fails to maintain its financial condition sufficient to qualify for licensure or registration on an original application, or, fails to maintain its registration or comply with all of the requirements of chapter 303, the commissioner may, after notice and hearing in accordance with the provisions of the laws of this state governing proceedings before administrative agencies, revoke a license or registration, or suspend a license or registration for a period as the commissioner deems proper.\nThe commissioner may investigate within or without this state as the commissioner deems necessary to determine whether any person has violated any provision of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977, Public Law 95-109 or of sections 332.31 to 332.44, or any rule or order thereunder; to determine whether a license or registration should be issued, renewed, or revoked; to aid in the enforcement of sections 332.31 to 332.44; or in prescribing rules and forms thereunder. The commissioner may publish information concerning any violation of sections 332.31 to 332.44 or any rule or order thereunder.\n(a) For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under sections 332.31 to 332.44, the commissioner or any person designated by the commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena collection agencies, debt buyers, or collectors and compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements or other documents or records which the commissioner deems relevant or material to the inquiry. The subpoena shall contain a written statement setting forth the circumstances which have reasonably caused the commissioner to believe that a violation of sections 332.31 to 332.44 may have occurred.\n(b) In the event that the collection agency, debt buyer, or collector refuses to obey the subpoena, or should the commissioner, upon completion of the examination of the collection agency, debt buyer, or collector, reasonably conclude that a violation has occurred, the commissioner may examine additional witnesses, including third parties, as may be necessary to complete the investigation.\n(c) Any subpoena issued pursuant to this section shall be served by certified mail or by personal service. Service shall be made at least 15 days prior to the date of appearance.\nIn case of contumacy by or refusal to obey a subpoena by any person the district court upon application by the commissioner may issue to the person an order directing the person to appear before the commissioner or commissioner's designee to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt of court.",
