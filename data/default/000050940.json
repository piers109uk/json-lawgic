The judgment debtor's earnings for personal services within 30 days preceding the order cannot be so applied, when it appears by the judgment debtor's affidavit that they are necessary for the use of a family supported, wholly or partly, by the judgment debtor's labor. The judge may appoint a receiver of the debtor's unexempt property, or forbid a transfer or other disposition thereof, or any interference therewith, until further order therein.",
