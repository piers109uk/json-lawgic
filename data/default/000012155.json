	"text": "A wetland preservation area continues in existence until the owner initiates expiration as provided in this section. The date of expiration must be at least eight years from the date of notice under this section.\nThe owner may initiate expiration of a wetland preservation area by notifying the county on a form prepared by the Board of Water and Soil Resources and made available in each county. The notice must describe the property involved and must state the date of expiration. The notice may be rescinded by the owner during the first two years following notice.\nWhen the county receives notice under subdivision 2, the county shall forward the original notice to the county recorder for recording or to the registrar of titles for filing if the land is registered and shall notify the regional development commission, where applicable, the Board of Water and Soil Resources, and the county soil and water conservation district of the date of expiration. The benefits and limitations of the wetland preservation area and the restrictive covenant filed with the application cease on the date of expiration. If the land is registered, the registrar of titles shall cancel the memorial of the application containing the restrictive covenant upon the certificate of title on the effective date of the expiration.\nA wetland preservation area may be terminated earlier than as provided in this section only in the event of a public emergency upon petition from the owner or county to the governor.
