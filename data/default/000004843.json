	"text": "All approved mark or brand applications must be sorted in a systematic manner and published in the state brand book. Supplements and revised brand books must be published at the discretion of the board. At least six months before expiration, all registered mark or brand owners and assignees must be notified in writing that their marks or brands will terminate in six months and that they must be renewed. A reregistration fee of $10 must be charged for the ensuing ten-year period or part of ten years. Failure to renew a mark or brand on or before the time specified, in accordance with sections 35.821 to 35.831, is an absolute abandonment to the state of the mark or brand. The board may not reissue a mark or brand abandoned under this section except to the original owner or, after a period of two years, to another applicant upon proper application.",
