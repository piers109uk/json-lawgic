	"text": "As an alternative to the procedure in sections 306.21 to 306.241, a cemetery association incorporated in Minnesota may use the procedures in this section to revest itself with the title to part of a cemetery that was conveyed by deed to a person but that has not been used for the purposes of burial for more than 60 years.\nThe governing board of a cemetery association may pass a resolution demanding that the owner of part of a cemetery that has been unused for more than 60 years express an interest in the cemetery plot. The board shall personally serve a copy of its resolution on the owner in the same manner as personal service of process in a civil action. The resolution must notify the owner that the owner shall, within 60 days of service of the resolution on the owner, express an interest in retaining the cemetery plot and submit satisfactory evidence of an intention to use the plot for a future burial.\nIf the owner cannot be personally served with the resolution of the board, as required in subdivision 2, because the owner cannot be found in this state or for another valid reason, the board shall publish its resolution for three successive weeks in a legal newspaper published in the county and mail a copy of the resolution within 14 days after the third publication to the owner's last known address.\nIf for 60 days after the personal service or publication of the board's resolution the owner or person with a legal interest in the cemetery plot fails to state a valid interest in the use of the cemetery plot for burial purposes, the owner's rights are terminated and that part of the cemetery again belongs to the cemetery association.",
