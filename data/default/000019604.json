	"text": "(a) A person who holds a license as a physician assistant shall annually, upon notification from the board, renew the license by:\n(1) submitting the appropriate fee as determined by the board;\n(2) completing the appropriate forms; and\n(3) meeting any other requirements of the board.\n(b) A licensee must maintain a correct mailing address with the board for receiving board communications, notices, and license renewal documents. Placing the license renewal application in first-class United States mail, addressed to the licensee at the licensee's last known address with postage prepaid, constitutes valid service. Failure to receive the renewal documents does not relieve a licensee of the obligation to comply with this section.\n(c) The name of a licensee who does not return a complete license renewal application, annual license fee, or late application fee, as applicable, within the time period required by this section shall be removed from the list of individuals authorized to practice during the current renewal period. If the licensee's license is reinstated, the licensee's name shall be placed on the list of individuals authorized to practice.",
