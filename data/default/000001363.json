	"title": "10.584 MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS MONTH.",
	"text": "The month of May is designated as Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month in recognition of the state's desire to recognize the prevalence of pregnancy and postpartum mental health issues and educate the people of the state about identifying symptoms and seeking treatment options. Up to one-third of mothers report having symptoms of pregnancy and postpartum mood and anxiety disorders each year. Many more cases go unreported due to misunderstanding. Pregnancy and postpartum mood disorders are widespread but treatable illnesses. Left untreated, pregnancy and postpartum mood and anxiety disorders can lead to negative effects on birth outcomes, infant development, and the well-being of mothers and families. The state declares that in order to educate the public, the governor may promote and encourage the observance of Maternal Mental Health Awareness Month.",
