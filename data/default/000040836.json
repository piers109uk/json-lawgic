	"text": "When a judgment is recovered against a county, or against a county officer, in an action prosecuted by or against the officer officially and the judgment is to be paid by the county, no execution shall issue except as provided in this section. Unless reversed, the judgment shall be paid from funds in the treasury, if available. If funds are not available, the unpaid amount of the judgment shall be levied and collected as other county charges, and, when collected, shall be paid to the person in whose favor the judgment was rendered, upon the delivery of a proper voucher. If payment is not made within 30 days after the time the treasurer is required by law to make settlement with the auditor next after the rendition of the judgment, execution may issue, but only the property of the county shall be liable on it.",
