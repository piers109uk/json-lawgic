	"text": "Any person doing business in this state and engaged in the distribution (other than at retail) of any prescription drugs, who shall discriminate between purchasers by selling prescription drugs at a lower price or rate to one purchaser or association of purchasers than offered to another purchaser or association of purchasers within this state (other than at retail) after making allowance for the difference, if any, in the grade, quality, or quantity, and after equalizing the distance from the point of distribution and freight costs therefrom, shall be guilty of unfair discrimination. Unfair discrimination occurs when quantity discounts are not reasonably based on actual cost savings to all like purchasers. Unfair discrimination shall embrace any scheme of special rebates, collateral contracts, or any device of any nature which in substance violates the provisions of this subdivision. Nothing in this subdivision shall apply to purchases for their own use by schools, colleges, universities, public libraries, churches, hospitals or charitable institutions not operated for profit.\nAny person injured by unfair discrimination as defined in subdivision 1 may bring a civil action and recover damages, together with costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney's fees, and receive other equitable relief as determined by the court. The remedies provided by this section are cumulative and shall not be construed as restricting any remedy which is otherwise available.",
