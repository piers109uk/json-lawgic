	"text": "The agency may establish the Minnesota urban and rural homesteading program for the purpose of making grants or loans to eligible applicants to acquire, rehabilitate, demolish or remove existing structures and construct new housing, and sell single family residential properties to home buyers committed to strengthening the neighborhood and following a good neighbor policy. If the grant or loan is used for demolition or removal of existing structures, the cleared land must be used for construction of housing owned by persons who meet the income limits of this program and the demolition and new construction must be less expensive than acquisition and rehabilitation.\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]\nMS 1990 [Repealed, 1992 c 522 s 48]",
