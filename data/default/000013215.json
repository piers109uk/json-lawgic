	"text": "The Pollution Control Agency is authorized to establish and implement a permit project under sections 114C.10 to 114C.19. The purpose of the project is to work toward the policy goals listed in section 114C.01 by issuing and studying the effect of permits that require permittees to reduce overall levels of pollution below what is required by applicable law, but which grant greater operational flexibility than current law would otherwise allow. Permits issued under this project shall be called Minnesota XL permits.\nBy January 15, 1998, the commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency shall report to the legislature on implementation of the project, the environmental results of the project, and recommendations for future legislation to further the policy of this chapter.",
