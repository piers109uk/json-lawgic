	"text": "(a) A water system may classify the actual material of a service line, such as copper or plastic, as an alternative to classifying the service line as a nonlead service line, for the purpose of the lead service line inventory.\n(b) It is not necessary to physically verify the material composition, such as copper or plastic, of a service line for its lead status to be identified. For example, if records demonstrate the service line was installed after a municipal, state, or federal ban on the installation of lead service lines, the service line may be classified as a nonlead service line.\nFor the purposes of the lead service line inventory and lead service line replacement plan, if a service line has a lead connector, the service line shall be classified as a lead service line or a galvanized service line requiring replacement.\nA galvanized service line may only be classified as a nonlead service line if there is documentation verifying it was never connected to a lead service line or lead connector. Rarely will a galvanized service line be considered a nonlead service line.",
