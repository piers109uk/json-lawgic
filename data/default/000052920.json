	"text": "A person brought into this state by, or after waiver of, extradition based on a criminal charge, shall not be subject to service of personal process in civil actions arising out of the same facts as the criminal proceedings to answer which the person is being or has been returned, until the person has been convicted in the criminal proceeding, or, if acquitted, until the person has had reasonable opportunity to return to the state from which the person was extradited.\nAny person arrested in this state charged with having committed any crime in another state or alleged to have escaped from confinement, or broken the terms of bail, probation, or parole, may waive the issuance and service of the warrant provided for in sections 629.07 and 629.08 and all other procedure incidental to extradition proceedings, by executing or subscribing, in the presence of a judge of any court of record within this state, a writing which states that the person consents to return to the demanding state; provided, that before such waiver shall be executed or subscribed by such person it shall be the duty of such judge to inform such person of the person's rights to the issuance and service of a warrant of extradition and to obtain a writ of habeas corpus, as provided for in section 629.10.\nIf and when such consent has been duly executed, it shall forthwith be forwarded to the Office of the Governor of this state and filed therein. The judge shall direct the officer having such person in custody to deliver forthwith such person to the duly accredited agent or agents of the demanding state, and shall deliver or cause to be delivered to such agent or agents a copy of such consent; provided, that nothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the rights of the accused person to return voluntarily and without formality to the demanding state, nor shall this waiver procedure be deemed to be an exclusive procedure or to limit the powers, rights, or duties of the officers of the demanding state or of this state.\nNothing in sections 629.01 to 629.29 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by this state of its right, power, or privilege to try such demanded person for crime committed within this state, or of its right, power, or privilege to regain custody of such person by extradition proceedings or otherwise for the purpose of trial, sentence, or punishment for any crime committed within this state, nor shall any proceedings had under sections 629.01 to 629.29 which result in, or fail to result in, extradition be deemed a waiver by this state of any of its rights, privileges, or jurisdiction in any way.",
