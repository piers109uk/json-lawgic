	"text": "(a) The commissioner shall determine a quality score for each nursing facility using quality measures established in section 256B.439, according to methods determined by the commissioner in consultation with stakeholders and experts, and using the most recently available data as provided in the Minnesota Nursing Home Report Card. These methods must be exempt from the rulemaking requirements under chapter 14.\n(b) For each quality measure, a score must be determined with the number of points assigned as determined by the commissioner using the methodology established according to this subdivision. The determination of the quality measures to be used and the methods of calculating scores may be revised annually by the commissioner.\n(c) The quality score must include up to 50 points related to the Minnesota quality indicators score derived from the minimum data set, up to 40 points related to the resident quality of life score derived from the consumer survey conducted under section 256B.439, subdivision 3, and up to ten points related to the state inspection results score.\n(d) The commissioner, in cooperation with the commissioner of health, may adjust the formula in paragraph (c), or the methodology for computing the total quality score, with five months advance public notice. In changing the formula, the commissioner shall consider quality measure priorities registered by report card users, advice of stakeholders, and available research.\nIf an annual cost report or field audit indicates that expenditures for direct resident care have been reduced in amounts large enough to indicate a possible detrimental effect on the quality of care, the commissioner shall notify the commissioner of health.",
