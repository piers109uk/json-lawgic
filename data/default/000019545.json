A person may not, in the conduct of an occupation or profession pertaining to the practice of acupuncture or in connection with the person's name, use the words or letters licensed acupuncturist, Minnesota licensed acupuncturist, or any other words, letters, abbreviations, or insignia indicating or implying that a person is an acupuncturist without a license issued under this section. A student attending an acupuncture training program must be identified as a student acupuncturist.\nA person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to discipline under section 147.091.\n(a) The following persons may practice acupuncture within the scope of their practice without an acupuncture license:\n(1) a physician licensed under chapter 147;\n(2) an osteopathic physician licensed under chapter 147;\n(3) a chiropractor licensed under chapter 148;\n(4) a person who is studying in a formal course of study so long as the person's acupuncture practice is supervised by a licensed acupuncturist or a person who is exempt under clause (5);\n(5) a visiting acupuncturist practicing acupuncture within an instructional setting for the sole purpose of teaching at a school registered with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education, who may practice without a license for a period of one year, with two one-year extensions permitted; and\n(6) a visiting acupuncturist who is in the state for the sole purpose of providing a tutorial or workshop not to exceed 30 days in one calendar year.\n(b) This chapter does not prohibit a person who does not have an acupuncturist license from practicing specific noninvasive techniques, such as acupressure, that are within the scope of practice as set forth in section 147B.06, subdivision 4.\nMS 2002 [Repealed, 2004 c 279 art 3 s 3]\nThe board shall issue an acupuncture license to a person who holds a current license or certificate as an acupuncturist from another jurisdiction if the board determines that the standards for certification or licensure in the other jurisdiction meet or exceed the requirements for licensure in Minnesota and a letter is received from that jurisdiction that the acupuncturist is in good standing in that jurisdiction.\n(a) An applicant for licensure must:\n(1) submit a completed application for licensure on forms provided by the board, which must include the applicant's name and address of record, which shall be public;\n(2) unless licensed under subdivision 5 or 6, submit evidence satisfactory to the board of current NCCAOM certification;\n(3) sign a statement that the information in the application is true and correct to the best of the applicant's knowledge and belief;\n(4) submit with the application all fees required; and\n(5) sign a waiver authorizing the board to obtain access to the applicant's records in this state or any state in which the applicant has engaged in the practice of acupuncture.\n(b) The board may ask the applicant to provide any additional information necessary to ensure that the applicant is able to practice with reasonable skill and safety to the public.\n(c) The board may investigate information provided by an applicant to determine whether the information is accurate and complete.

Placing the license renewal application in first-class United States mail, addressed to the applicant at the applicant's last known address with postage prepaid, constitutes valid service. Failure to receive the renewal documents does not relieve an applicant of the obligation to comply with this section.\n(d) The name of an applicant who does not return a complete license renewal application, annual license fee, or late application fee, as applicable, within the time period required by this section shall be removed from the list of individuals authorized to practice during the current renewal period.

The board may not renew or restore a license that has lapsed and has not been renewed within two annual license renewal cycles.\n(b) An inactive license may be reactivated by the license holder upon application to the board. A licensee whose license is canceled for nonrenewal must obtain a new license by applying for licensure and fulfilling all the requirements then in existence for the initial license to practice acupuncture in the state of Minnesota. The application must include:\n(1) evidence of current and active NCCAOM certification;\n(2) evidence of the certificate holder's payment of an inactive status fee;\n(3) an annual fee; and\n(4) all back fees since previous renewal.\n(c) A person licensed under subdivision 5 who has allowed the license to reach inactive status must become NCCAOM certified.\n(a) A licensee whose license has lapsed under subdivision 4 before January 1, 2020, and who seeks to regain licensed status after January 1, 2020, shall be treated as a first-time licensee only for purposes of establishing a license renewal schedule, and shall not be subject to the license cycle conversion provisions in section 147B.09.\n(b) This subdivision expires July 1, 2022.\nThe board may issue a temporary permit to practice acupuncture to an applicant eligible for licensure under this section only if the application for licensure is complete, all applicable requirements in this section have been met, and a nonrefundable fee set by the board has been paid. The permit remains valid only until the meeting of the board at which a decision is made on the acupuncturist's application for licensure.",
