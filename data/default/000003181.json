The complaint shall summon the person to a hearing before the commissioner at the time and place fixed.\nIf the commissioner determines that the person complained of has committed a practice in violation of sections 17.691 to 17.702, the commissioner shall state findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the person an order to cease the violation and shall order further affirmative action as will effectuate the policies of sections 17.691 to 17.702.\nIf the commissioner is of the opinion that the person complained of has not committed a practice in violation of sections 17.691 to 17.702, the commissioner shall make findings of fact and issue an order dismissing the complaint.\nUntil the record in a case has been filed in a court the commissioner may, at any time upon reasonable notice and in such manner as the commissioner deems proper, modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued, with jurisdiction for such a change specified in additional findings of fact.\nThe commissioner may request the attorney general of the state of Minnesota to seek the appropriate temporary relief or restraining order of injunction in district court to insure the enforcement of the commissioner's findings.",
