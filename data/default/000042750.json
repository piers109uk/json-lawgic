No bonds shall be issued in an amount which would cause the net debt to exceed one-tenth of one percent of such full and true valuation without first obtaining the approval of a majority of the electors voting on the question at an election called in the manner provided in section 398.16.\nThe ballot at any bond election shall state the maximum amount and purpose or purposes of the proposed issue, and no issue shall be invalidated by reason of the inclusion in the ballot of more than one purpose. Taxes for the payment of principal and interest on bonds, whether levied before the issuance thereof or levied subsequently to restore deficiencies in the bond sinking fund, shall not be subject to any limitation as to rate or amount and shall not be included in determining the application of any statutory limitation to other tax levies.",
