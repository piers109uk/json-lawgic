	"text": "When the commissioner or the commissioner's agent has reasonable cause to believe any lot of commercial feed is being distributed in violation of any of the provisions of sections 25.31 to 25.43 or of any of the prescribed rules under sections 25.31 to 25.43, the commissioner or the commissioner's agent may issue and enforce a written or printed \"withdrawal from distribution\" order, warning the distributor not to dispose of the lot of commercial feed in any manner until written permission is given by the commissioner or the court. The commissioner shall release the lot of withdrawn commercial feed when sections 25.31 to 25.43 and associated rules have been complied with. If compliance is not obtained within 30 days, the commissioner may begin, or upon request of the distributor or license holder shall begin, proceedings for condemnation.\nAny lot of commercial feed not in compliance with sections 25.31 to 25.43 and associated rules is subject to seizure on complaint of the commissioner to the district court of the county in which the commercial feed is located. In the event the court finds the commercial feed to be in violation of sections 25.31 to 25.43 and orders the condemnation of the commercial feed, the commercial feed must be disposed of in a manner consistent with the quality of the commercial feed and the laws of the state; provided, that in no instance, shall the disposition of the commercial feed be ordered by the court without first giving the claimant an opportunity to apply to the court for release of the commercial feed or for permission to process or relabel the commercial feed to bring it into compliance with sections 25.31 to 25.43.",
