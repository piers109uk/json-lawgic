and\n(2) the sum of entrance fees received or receivable by the provider pursuant to binding contracts for continuing care, plus the anticipated proceeds of any first mortgage loan or other long-term financing commitment, plus funds from other sources in the actual possession of the provider, equals or exceeds the sum of 90 percent of the aggregate cost of constructing or purchasing, equipping and furnishing the facility plus 90 percent of the funds estimated in the statement of anticipated source and application of funds submitted by the provider as part of its permit application, to be necessary to fund start-up losses of the facility plus 90 percent of the amount of the reserve fund escrow, if any, required to be maintained by the provider pursuant to section 80D.06; and\n(3) a commitment has been received by the provider for any permanent mortgage loan or other long-term financing described in the statement of anticipated source and application of funds included in the current disclosure statement on file pursuant to section 80D.04, and any conditions of the commitment prior to disbursement of funds thereunder, other than completion of the construction or closing of the purchase of the facility, have been substantially satisfied; and\n(4) if construction of the facility has not been substantially completed, all governmental permits or approvals necessary prior to the commencement of construction have been obtained; and a maximum price contract has been entered into between the provider and a general contractor responsible for construction of the facility; a bond covering the faithful performance of the construction contract by the general contractor and the payment of all obligations arising thereunder has been issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this state with the provider as obligee; a loan agreement has been entered into by the provider for an interim construction loan in an amount which, when combined with the amount of entrance fees then held in escrow under the provisions of this section plus the amount of funds from other sources then in the actual possession of the provider, will equal or exceed the estimated cost of constructing, equipping and furnishing the facility; not less than ten percent of the amount of the construction loan has been disbursed by the lender for physical construction or site preparation work completed; and orders at firm prices have been placed by the provider for not less than 50 percent in value, including installation charges if applicable, of items necessary for equipping and furnishing the facility in accordance with the description set forth in the disclosure statement required by section 80D.04;
