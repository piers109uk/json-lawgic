	"text": "A will may refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will, other than money and coin collections, and property used in trade or business. To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing must be referred to in the will, must be either in the handwriting of the testator or be signed by the testator, and must describe the items and the devisees with reasonable certainty. The writing may be referred to as one to be in existence at the time of the testator's death; it may be prepared before or after the execution of the will; it may be altered by the testator after its preparation; and it may be a writing which has no significance apart from its effect upon the dispositions made by the will.\nA writing may include multiple writings and if an item of tangible personal property is disposed of to different persons by different writings, the most recent writing controls the disposition of the item.",
