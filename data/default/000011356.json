	"text": "(a) The commissioner may, by rules adopted under chapter 14, prescribe the dollar value to the state of species of wild animals. The value may reflect the value to other persons to legally take the wild animal, the replacement cost, or the intrinsic value to the state of the wild animals. Species of wild animals with similar values may be grouped together.\n(b) The value of a wild animal under the rules adopted by the commissioner is prima facie evidence of a wild animal's value under section 97A.341.\n(c) The commissioner shall report annually to the legislature the amount of restitution collected under section 97A.341 and the manner in which the funds were expended.\n(d) When a person kills, injures, or possesses a wild animal in violation of section 343.21, the restitution value prescribed by the commissioner under paragraph (a) is doubled.",
