	"text": "Sections 453.51 to 453.62 are intended to provide a means for those Minnesota cities which now or hereafter own and operate a utility pursuant to law for the local distribution of electric energy to secure, by individual or joint action among themselves or by contract with other public or private entities within or outside the state, an adequate, economical, and reliable supply of energy. It is also the purpose of sections 453.51 to 453.62 to provide a means for Minnesota cities to construct and operate hydroelectric generating plants. To accomplish these purposes it is necessary for such cities to have power, by agreement between or among two or more of their number, to create a separate municipal corporation with the power and authority to finance and acquire facilities for the generation or transmission of electric energy, or interests in such facilities or rights to part of all of the capacity thereof. It is determined that an adequate, economical, and reliable supply of electric energy is essential to the orderly growth and prosperity of these communities, and a shortage of such energy is inimical to the safety, health, morale, and welfare of residents of the state and to the sound growth and developments of its communities. Such a shortage exists and is expected to continue or increase because of the difficulty, among others, in the operation of municipal generating plants, of achieving economies of size, limiting environmental impacts, and providing for peak loads. Accordingly it is determined that the exercise of the powers granted herein will benefit the people of the state and serve a valid public purpose in improving and otherwise promoting their health, welfare, and prosperity.",
