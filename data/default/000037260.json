	"text": "Each year, each registrant under the provisions of this chapter must, not more than 60 nor less than 30 days before its registration is to expire, apply to the commissioner for renewal of its registration on a form prescribed by the commissioner. The application must be signed by the registrant under penalty of perjury, contain current information on all matters required in the original application, and be accompanied by a payment of $250. The registrant must maintain a continuous surety bond that satisfies the requirements of section 332A.04, subdivision 4, provided that the commissioner may require a different amount that is at least equal to the largest amount that has accrued in the registrant's trust account during the previous year. The renewal is effective for one year. The commissioner may, for good cause shown, temporarily waive any requirement of this section.",
