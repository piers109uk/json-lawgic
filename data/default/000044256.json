After commencement of existence, the first meeting of the board of directors shall be held at the call of the directors, after notice, for the purpose of adopting the initial bylaws, electing officers, and for any other business that comes before the meeting.\n(a) The bylaws of the municipal gas agency, and any amendments thereto, shall be proposed by the board of directors and shall be adopted by a majority vote of the representatives of the member cities, unless the agency agreement requires a greater vote, at a meeting held after notice.\n(b) Subject to the provisions of the agency agreement, the bylaws shall state:\n(1) the qualifications of member cities, and limitations, if any, upon their number;\n(2) conditions of membership, if any;\n(3) manner and time of calling regular meetings of representatives of member cities;\n(4) manner and conditions of termination of membership;\n(5) manner and conditions of agency dissolution; and\n(6) such other provisions for regulating the affairs of the municipal gas agency as the representatives of the member cities shall determine to be necessary.\nEvery municipal gas agency shall maintain an office in this state to be known as its registered office. When a municipal gas agency desires to change the location of its registered office, it shall file with the secretary of state a certificate of change of location of registered office, stating the new location by city, town, or other community and effective date of change. When the certificate of change of location has been duly filed, the board of directors may make the change without any further action.\nEach of the directors shall hold office for the term for which selected and until a successor has been selected and has qualified. Directors shall discharge their duties in good faith, and with that diligence and care which an ordinary prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances.

Except where the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe otherwise, the term of office of a director shall be for one year. Except where the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe otherwise, a meeting of the board of directors may be held at any place, within or without the state, designated by the board, after notice, and an act of the majority of the directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present is the act of the board. Except where the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe otherwise, any vacancy occurring on the board shall be filled by a person nominated by the remaining members of the board and elected by a majority of representatives of the member cities.\nExcept where the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe otherwise, the board of directors shall appoint a president from its membership, and a secretary and treasurer, and any other officers or agents deemed to be necessary, who may but need not be city representatives or directors. An officer may be removed with or without cause by the board of directors. Officers of the municipal gas agency shall have the authority and duties in the management of the business of the municipal gas agency that the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe, or, in the absence of such prescription, as the board of directors determines.\nExcept as otherwise provided in the agency agreement or the bylaws, the duly authorized representatives of each member city shall act as, and vote on behalf of, such city. Except where the agency agreement or bylaws provide otherwise, representatives of the member cities shall hold at least one meeting each year for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business. Except where the agency agreement or bylaws prescribe otherwise, special meetings of the representatives may be called for any purpose upon written request to the president or secretary to call the meeting. Such officer shall give notice of the meeting to be held between ten and 60 days after receipt of such request. Unless the agency agreement or bylaws provide for a different percentage, a quorum for a meeting of the representatives of the member cities is a majority of the total members and a quorum for meetings of the board of directors is a majority of the membership of such board.\nThe agency agreement may be amended as proposed at any meeting of the representatives of the members for which notice, stating the purpose, shall be given to each representative and, unless the agency agreement or bylaws require otherwise, shall become effective when ratified by resolutions of a majority of the governing bodies of the member cities. Each amendment and the resolutions approving it shall be filed for record with the secretary of state.\nEach member city shall have full power and authority, within budgetary limits applicable to it, to appropriate money for the payment of expenses of the formation of the municipal gas agency and of its representative in exercising its functions as a member of the agency.",
