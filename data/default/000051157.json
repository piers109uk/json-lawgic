	"text": "A receivership may be either a limited receivership or a general receivership. Any receivership which is based upon the enforcement of an assignment of rents or leases, or the foreclosure of a mortgage lien, judgment lien, mechanic's lien, or other lien pursuant to which the respondent or any holder of a lien would have a statutory right of redemption, shall be a limited receivership. If the order appointing the receiver does not specify whether the receivership is a limited receivership or a general receivership, the receivership shall be a limited receivership unless and until the court by later order designates the receivership as a general receivership, notwithstanding that pursuant to section 576.25, subdivision 8, a receiver may have control over all the property of the respondent. At any time, the court may order a general receivership to be converted to a limited receivership and a limited receivership to be converted to a general receivership.",
