These amounts are in addition to the breeders fund and purse requirements set forth elsewhere in this chapter.\n(1) For amounts between zero and $6,000,000, the licensee shall set aside not less than ten percent to be used as purses.\n(2) For amounts in excess of $6,000,000, the licensee shall set aside not less than 14 percent to be used as purses.\n(b) From all amounts set aside under paragraph (a), the licensee shall set aside ten percent to be deposited in the breeders fund.\n(c) It is the intent of the legislature that the proceeds of the card playing activities authorized by this chapter be used to improve the horse racing industry by improving purses. The licensee and the horseperson's organization representing the majority of horsepersons who have raced at the racetrack during the preceding 12 months may negotiate percentages that exceed those stated in this section if the agreement is in writing and reviewed by the commission for compliance with this section. The commission shall annually review the financial details of card playing activities and determine if the present use of card playing proceeds is consistent with the policy established by this paragraph. If the commission determines that the use of the proceeds does not comply with the policy set forth herein, then the commission shall direct the parties to make the changes necessary to ensure compliance. If these changes require legislation, the commission shall make the appropriate recommendations to the legislature.",
