	"text": "By July 1, 1988, county boards must provide or contract for enough residential treatment services to meet the needs of all adults with mental illness residing in the county and needing this level of care. Residential treatment services include both intensive and structured residential treatment with length of stay based on client residential treatment need. Services must be as close to the county as possible. Residential treatment must be designed to:\n(1) prevent placement in settings that are more intensive, costly, or restrictive than necessary and appropriate to meet client needs;\n(2) help clients achieve the highest level of independent living;\n(3) help clients gain the necessary skills to function in a less structured setting; and\n(4) stabilize crisis admissions.\nProviders of residential services must be licensed under chapter 245I or applicable rules adopted by the commissioner. Residential services must be provided under treatment supervision.\nResidential treatment programs must plan for and assist clients in making a transition from residential treatment facilities to other community-based services. In coordination with the client's case manager, if any, residential treatment facilities must also arrange for appropriate follow-up care in the community during the transition period. Before a client is discharged, the residential treatment facility must notify the client's case manager, so that the case manager can monitor and coordinate the transition and arrangements for the client's appropriate follow-up care in the community.\nNo later than January 1, 1992, the county board shall ensure that placement decisions for residential services are based on the clinical needs of the adult. The county board shall ensure that each entity under contract with the county to provide residential treatment services has admission, continued stay, discharge criteria and discharge planning criteria as part of the contract. Contracts shall specify specific responsibilities between the county and service providers to ensure comprehensive planning and continuity of care between needed services according to data privacy requirements. All contracts for the provision of residential services must include provisions guaranteeing clients the right to appeal under section 245.477 and to be advised of their appeal rights.",
