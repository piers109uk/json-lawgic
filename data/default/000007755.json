	"text": "A health carrier ceding an individual to the reinsurance association shall be assessed a monthly reinsurance coverage premium that is 5.0 times the adjusted average market price. A health carrier ceding an entire group to the reinsurance association shall be assessed a monthly reinsurance coverage premium that is 1.5 times the adjusted average market price. The adjusted average market premium price must be established by the board of directors in accordance with its plan of operation. The board may consider benefit levels in establishing the reinsurance coverage premium.\nThe board of directors shall establish operating rules to allocate adjustments to the reinsurance premium charge of no more than minus 25 percent of the monthly reinsurance premium for health carriers that can demonstrate administrative efficiencies and cost-effective handling of equivalent risks. The adjustment must be made monthly, unless the board provides for a different interval in its operating rules. The operating rules must establish objective and measurable criteria which must be met by a health carrier in order to be eligible for an adjustment. These criteria must include consideration of efficiency attributable to case management, but not consideration of such factors as provider discounts.\nA health carrier is liable for the cost of the reinsurance premium and may not directly charge the small employer for the costs. The reinsurance premium may be reflected only in the rating factors permitted in section 62L.08, as provided in section 62L.08, subdivision 10.",
