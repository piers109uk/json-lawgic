	"text": "The bylaws of an electric cooperative that has 35,000 or more members and that nominates, elects, or otherwise selects directors on a district or local unit basis must provide that representation on the board be apportioned equally throughout the different districts or local units in proportion to the membership residing in or belonging to the districts or units. The number of members in any one district or unit may not vary by more than ten percent from the average number of members for the districts or units.\nThe bylaws must provide for a survey to take place at least once every ten years to determine whether the number of members in a district or local unit has changed. If the number of members in a district or local unit changes by 15 percent or more, the bylaws must provide for changes in the districts or local units so that representation on the board continues to be apportioned equally throughout the districts or units in proportion to the membership.",
