The report is due August 1 each year. For permit applications that have not met the goal, the report must state the reasons for not meeting the goal. In stating the reasons for not meeting the goal, the commissioner shall separately identify delays caused by the responsiveness of the proposer, lack of staff, scientific or technical disagreements, or the level of public engagement.

If the commissioner determines that the application is complete, the notice must confirm the application's tier 1 or tier 2 permit status. If the commissioner believes that a complete application for a tier 2 construction permit cannot be issued within the 150-day goal, the commissioner must provide notice to the applicant with the commissioner's notice that the application is complete and, upon request of the applicant, provide the permit applicant with a schedule estimating when the agency will begin drafting the permit and issue the public notice of the draft permit. This paragraph does not apply to an application for a permit that is subject to a grant or loan agreement under chapter 446A.\n(e) When public notice of a draft individual tier 2 permit is required, the commissioner must provide the applicant a draft permit for review by the applicant within 30 days after determining the proposal conforms to all federal and state laws and rules, unless the permit applicant and the commissioner mutually agree to a different date. The commissioner must consider all comments submitted by the applicant before issuing the permit.\nPermit applicants needing any permit from the commissioner of natural resources to construct, reconstruct, or modify a project or to operate a facility may offer to reimburse the department for the costs of staff time or consultant services needed to expedite the preapplication process and permit development process through the final decision on the permit, including the analysis of environmental review documents. The reimbursement shall be in addition to permit application fees imposed by law. When the commissioner determines that additional resources are needed to develop the permit application in an expedited manner, and that expediting the development is consistent with permitting program priorities, the commissioner may accept the reimbursement. The commissioner must give the permit applicant an estimate of costs for the expedited service to be incurred by the commissioner. The estimate must include a brief description of the tasks to be performed, a schedule for completing the tasks, and the estimated cost for each task. The proposer and the commissioner shall enter into a written agreement detailing the estimated costs for the expedited service to be incurred by the department.

The fee is not required by state law.\";\n(4) establish, by written order, an electronic licensing system commission to be paid by revenues generated from all sales made through the electronic licensing system. The commissioner shall establish the commission in a manner that neither significantly overrecovers nor underrecovers costs involved in providing the electronic licensing system; and\n(5) adopt rules to administer the provisions of this subdivision.\n(b) The fees established under paragraph (a), clauses (2) and (3), and the commission established under paragraph (a), clause (4), are not subject to the rulemaking procedures of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.\n(c) Money received from fees and commissions collected under this subdivision, including interest earned, is annually appropriated from the game and fish fund and the natural resources fund to the commissioner for the cost of electronic licensing.\n(d) Game and fish licenses under chapters 97A, 97B, and 97C shall be available by electronic transaction, regardless of whether all or any part of the biennial appropriation law for the department has been enacted.

As necessary, the commissioner may transfer a portion of this appropriation to other state agencies to support carrying out these functions. Any subsequent appropriation to the commissioner of management and budget for a biennium in which this section is applicable supersedes and replaces the funding authorized in this paragraph.\n[See Note.]\nUnless otherwise specified by law, the commissioner may establish the procedures and criteria for selection of projects funded through authorized grants and research programs.

The commissioner shall biennially report to the Legislative Permanent School Fund Commission and the legislature on the management of the school trust lands that shows how the commissioner has and will continue to achieve the following goals:\n(1) manage the school trust lands efficiently and in a manner that reflects the undivided loyalty to the beneficiaries consistent with the commissioner's fiduciary duties;\n(2) reduce the management expenditures of school trust lands and maximize the revenues deposited in the permanent school trust fund;\n(3) manage the sale, exchange, and commercial leasing of school trust lands, requiring returns of not less than fair market value, to maximize the revenues deposited in the permanent school trust fund and retain the value from the long-term appreciation of the school trust lands;\n(4) manage the school trust lands to maximize the long-term economic return for the permanent school trust fund while maintaining sound natural resource conservation and management principles;\n(5) optimize school trust land revenues and maximize the value of the trust consistent with balancing short-term and long-term interests, so that long-term benefits are not lost in an effort to maximize short-term gains; and\n(6) maintain the integrity of the trust and prevent the misapplication of its lands and its revenues.\n(b) When the commissioner finds an irresolvable conflict between maximizing the long-term economic return and protecting natural resources and recreational values on school trust lands, the commissioner shall give precedence to the long-term economic return in managing school trust lands. By July 1, 2018, the permanent school fund must be compensated for all school trust lands included under a designation or policy provision that prohibits long-term economic return. The commissioner shall submit recommendations to the appropriate legislative committees and divisions on methods of funding for the compensation required under this paragraph, including recommendations for appropriations from the general fund, nongeneral funds, and the state bond fund. Any uncompensated designation or policy provision restrictions on the long-term economic return on school trust lands remaining after July 1, 2018, must be compiled and submitted to the Legislative Permanent School Fund Commission for review.\n(c) By December 31, 2013, the report required under paragraph (a) must provide an inventory and identification of all school trust lands that are included under a designation or policy provision that prohibits long-term economic return. The report must include a plan to compensate the permanent school fund through the purchase or exchange of the lands or a plan to manage the school trust land to generate long-term economic return to the permanent school fund. Subsequent reports under paragraph (a) must include a status report of the commissioner's progress in maximizing the long-term economic return on lands identified in the 2013 report.\n(d) When management practices, policies, or designations by the commissioner diminish or prohibit the long-term economic return on school trust land, the conflict must be resolved as provided in section 92.122.\nNotwithstanding any law to the contrary, the commissioner may establish, by written order, policies for the use and operation of other power-driven mobility devices, as defined under Code of Federal Regulations, title 28, section 35.104, on lands and in facilities administered by the commissioner for the purposes of implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act, United States Code, title 42, section 12101 et seq. These policies are exempt from the rulemaking provisions of chapter 14 and section 14.386 does not apply.\nThe commissioner may allow critically ill persons to purchase, once in a lifetime, hunting licenses otherwise limited by a lottery drawing, which licenses allow for taking game within established hunting seasons or season frameworks. The commissioner may provide the licenses to persons who are participating in a program for critically ill hunters sponsored by a nonprofit organization with expertise in providing hunting opportunities to hunters who are gravely ill or have physical disabilities. The commissioner may provide licenses or permits otherwise limited by drawings, including wild turkey, deer, bear, prairie chicken, and wolf.
