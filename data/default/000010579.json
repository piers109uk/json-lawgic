Notwithstanding any law to the contrary neither the state nor any of its subdivisions shall be required to construct or maintain any street, highway or other road to provide access to any parcel of land sold or exchanged pursuant to this section. The commissioner of natural resources may retain easements over parcels sold or exchanged pursuant to this section as are required for purposes of providing access to public waters or forest lands or access to insure stream bank stabilization and protection.\nThe commissioner of natural resources may apply to the county board for an exemption from the exchange or sale requirements of subdivision 1 in instances where it can be demonstrated that tillable land has been or will be acquired for natural resource and public access purposes. The county board may approve or disapprove the exemption.
