If the health carrier offers a qualified health plan through MNsure, the health carrier must comply with paragraph (a).\nMNsure may not, by contract or otherwise, mandate the types of health plans to be offered by a health carrier to individuals or small employers purchasing health plans outside of MNsure. Solely for purposes of this subdivision, \"health plan\" includes coverage that is excluded under section 62A.011, subdivision 3, clause (6).\nFor purposes of this section, the metal levels and catastrophic plans are defined in section 1302(d) and (e) of the Affordable Care Act.\nThe commissioner of commerce shall enforce this section.",
