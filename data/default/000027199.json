	"text": "The commission may sponsor and sanction a series of statewide amateur athletic games patterned after the winter and summer Olympic Games, with variations as required by facilities, equipment, and expertise, and as necessary to include people with physical disabilities, people with vision impairments, and people who are deaf, deafblind, and hard-of-hearing. The games may be held annually beginning in 1989, if money and facilities are available, unless the time of the games would conflict with other sporting events as the commission determines.\nThe games must be designed to encourage the participation of athletes representing a broad range of age groups, skill levels, Minnesota communities, and people with physical disabilities, people with vision impairments, and people who are deaf, deafblind, and hard-of-hearing. Primary participants must be residents of Minnesota. Regional competitions to determine participants in the games may be held throughout the state, and the top qualifiers in each sport or the regional competitions are qualified to participate in the state amateur athletic games. The games must be held at an appropriate site in the state.",
