The commissioners of agriculture, natural resources, and health, the dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, and the director of the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota may serve as consultants to the board without vote. Appointments to fill unexpired terms must be made from the classes to which the retiring members belong. The board shall elect a president and a vice-president from among its members and a veterinarian licensed in Minnesota who is not a member to be its executive director for a term of one year and until a successor qualifies. The board shall set the duties of the director.\nThe membership terms, compensation, removal of members, and filling of vacancies on the board are governed by section 15.0575.",
