	"text": "(a) No person in the classified service who shall have been permanently appointed or inducted into the classified service under provisions of sections 383C.03 to 383C.056 shall be removed, suspended, demoted or discharged except for cause. Any person so removed, suspended, demoted, or discharged, may appeal to the county civil service commission within ten days from the written notification of the removal, suspension, demotion or discharge. The appeal shall be confined to the determination of the question of whether such removal, suspension, demotion or discharge was or was not made for cause. After a hearing, the commission may affirm or reverse the action being appealed.\n(b) All appeals heard by the commission pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be by public hearing in accordance with section 13D.01. After notice to the appellant of the time and place of such hearing, the appellant shall be afforded the opportunity to appear and present the basis for the appeal in person. Either the appellant or the human resources director may appeal the commission's decision to the district court where the issue shall be heard de novo and determined in the same manner as a court case. The district court shall hear and determine the appeal in a summary manner, provided, however, that such hearing shall be confined to the determination of whether the decision of the commission was or was not made in good faith for cause, and no appeal to such court shall be taken except upon such grounds.",
