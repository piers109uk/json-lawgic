	"text": "(a) County agencies may develop grant diversion programs for MFIP participants participating in employment and training services. A county agency that chooses to provide grant diversion may divert to an employer part or all of the MFIP cash payment for the participant's assistance unit, in compliance with federal regulations and laws. Such payments to an employer are to subsidize employment for MFIP participants as an alternative to public assistance payments.\n(b) In addition to diverting the MFIP grant to the employer, employment and training funds may be used to subsidize the grant diversion placement.\n(c) Participants in grant diversion shall be compensated by the employer at the same rates, including periodic increases, as similarly situated employees or trainees and in accordance with applicable law, but in no event less than the federal or applicable state minimum wage, whichever is higher.\n(a) County agencies shall limit the length of training to nine months. Placement in a grant diversion training position with an employer is for the purpose of training and employment with the same employer who has agreed to retain the person upon satisfactory completion of training.\n(b) Placement of any participant in a grant diversion subsidized training position must be compatible with the assessment and employment plan or employability development plan established for the recipient under section 142G.56.",
