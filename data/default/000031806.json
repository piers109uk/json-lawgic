	"text": "Immediately after preparing forms for printing such notice and list, and at least five days before the first day for the publication thereof, every publisher shall furnish proof of the proposed publication to the county auditor for correction. When the copy has been corrected, the auditor shall return it to the printer, who shall publish it as corrected. On the first day on which the notice and list are published, the publisher shall mail a copy of the newspaper containing the notice and list to the auditor. If during the publication of the notice and list, or within ten days after the last publication thereof, the auditor discovers that the publication contains an error, the auditor shall direct the publisher to publish the correct information for an additional period of two weeks. The auditor does not have to direct the publisher to republish the entire list. The publisher, if not neglectful, is entitled to compensation as allowed by law for publication of the corrected information, but shall receive no further compensation if the republication is necessary by reason of the neglect of the publisher.",
