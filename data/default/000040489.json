	"text": "The intent of the legislature in sections 352.01, subdivision 25; 353.01, subdivision 37; 354.05, subdivision 38; and 354A.011, subdivision 15a is to create a normal retirement age for persons first covered by those sections after the effective date of those sections that is the same as the retirement age in the federal Social Security law, including future amendments to that law. If a court determines that the legislature may not incorporate by reference the future changes in federal Social Security law, the legislature reserves the right to amend the appropriate sections to make the normal retirement conform to the retirement age in the federal Social Security law. No person first covered by any of those sections after the effective date of those sections has a right to a normal retirement age that is less than the retirement age in the federal Social Security law.",
