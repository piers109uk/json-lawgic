	"text": "Except as provided in section 149A.01, subdivision 3, no person shall maintain, manage, or operate a place or premises devoted to or used in the holding and cremation of a dead human body without possessing a valid license to operate a crematory issued by the commissioner of health.\n(a) A crematory licensed under this section must consist of:\n(1) a building or structure that complies with applicable local and state building codes, zoning laws and ordinances, and environmental standards, containing one or more cremation chambers or retorts for the cremation of dead human bodies;\n(2) a motorized mechanical device for grinding, crushing, or pulverizing the cremated remains to a granulated appearance appropriate for final disposition; and\n(3) an appropriate holding facility for dead human bodies awaiting cremation.\n(b) A crematory licensed under this section may also contain a display room for funeral goods.\nAn applicant for a license to operate a crematory shall submit to the commissioner a completed application. A completed application includes:\n(1) a completed application form, as provided by the commissioner;\n(2) proof of business form and ownership; and\n(3) proof of liability insurance coverage or other financial documentation, as determined by the commissioner, that demonstrates the applicant's ability to respond in damages for liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, management, or operation of a crematory.\nUpon receipt of the application and appropriate fee, the commissioner shall review and verify all information. Upon completion of the verification process and resolution of any deficiencies in the application information, the commissioner shall conduct an initial inspection of the premises to be licensed. After the inspection and resolution of any deficiencies found and any reinspections as may be necessary, the commissioner shall make a determination, based on all the information available, to grant or deny licensure. If the commissioner's determination is to grant the license, the applicant shall be notified and the license shall issue and remain valid for a period prescribed on the license, but not to exceed one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license. If the commissioner's determination is to deny the license, the commissioner must notify the applicant, in writing, of the denial and provide the specific reason for denial.\nA license to operate a crematory is not assignable or transferable and shall not be valid for any person other than the one named. Each license issued to operate a crematory is valid only for the location identified on the license. A 50 percent or more change in ownership or location of the crematory automatically terminates the license. Separate licenses shall be required of two or more persons or other legal entities operating from the same location.\nEach license to operate a crematory must be conspicuously displayed in the crematory at all times. Conspicuous display means in a location where a member of the general public within the crematory will be able to observe and read the license.\n[Repealed, 2013 c 108 art 12 s 109]\nAll licenses to operate a crematory issued by the commissioner are valid for a period of one calendar year beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30, regardless of the date of issuance.\nAny change of license information must be reported to the commissioner, on forms provided by the commissioner, no later than 30 calendar days after the change occurs. Failure to report changes is grounds for disciplinary action.\nAll information submitted to the commissioner by an applicant for a license to operate a crematory is classified as licensing data under section 13.41, subdivision 5.",
