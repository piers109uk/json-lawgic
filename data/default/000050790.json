	"text": "(a) Not later than 30 days after notice under section 548.69 is served, the person against whom the judgment was registered may petition the court to vacate the registration. The court for cause may provide for a shorter or longer time for filing the petition.\n(b) A petition under this section may assert only:\n(1) a ground that could be asserted to deny recognition of the judgment under sections 548.54 to 548.63; or\n(2) a failure to comply with a requirement of sections 548.64 to 548.74 for registration of the judgment.\n(c) A petition filed under this section does not itself stay enforcement of the registered judgment.\n(d) If the court grants a petition under this section, the registration is vacated, and any act under the registration to enforce the registered judgment is void.\n(e) If the court grants a petition under this section on a ground under paragraph (b), clause (1), the court also shall render a judgment denying recognition of the Canadian judgment. A judgment rendered under this subsection has the same effect as a judgment denying recognition to a judgment on the same ground under sections 548.54 to 548.63.",
