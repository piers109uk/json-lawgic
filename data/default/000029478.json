	"text": "For the purposes of this section, \"eligible postsecondary institution\" means:\n(1) the University of Minnesota;\n(2) a postsecondary institution governed by the Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities; or\n(3) a Tribal college, which includes Leech Lake Tribal College, White Earth Tribal College, or Red Lake Nation Tribal College.\nEligible postsecondary institutions are eligible to receive unemployment insurance aid under this section. For each fiscal year, an eligible entity's aid is the difference between fiscal year 2022's unemployment insurance costs and the current year's unemployment insurance costs, as reflected in the unemployment insurance employer accounts maintained by the state. If the total eligible unemployment insurance aid for a fiscal year is greater than the annual appropriation for that year, the Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities or the commissioner of the Office of Higher Education, as applicable, must proportionately reduce the aid payment to each eligible entity.",
