	"text": "The commissioner, in consultation with the commissioner of natural resources, commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency, and Board of Water and Soil Resources, may implement a Minnesota agricultural water quality certification program whereby a producer who demonstrates practices and management sufficient to protect water quality is certified for up to ten years and presumed to be contributing the producer's share of any targeted reduction of water pollutants during the certification period. The program is voluntary. The voluntary program will first be piloted in selected watersheds across the state, until the commissioner, in consultation with the Minnesota Agricultural Water Quality Certification Program Advisory Committee, commissioner of natural resources, commissioner of the Pollution Control Agency, and Board of Water and Soil Resources, determines the program is suitable to be implemented in other watersheds.",
