	"text": "(a) When the responsible social services agency places a child in a qualified residential treatment program as defined in section 260C.007, subdivision 26d, the out-of-home placement plan must include:\n(1) the case plan requirements in section 260C.212;\n(2) the reasonable and good faith efforts of the responsible social services agency to identify and include all of the individuals required to be on the child's family and permanency team under section 260C.007;\n(3) all contact information for members of the child's family and permanency team and for other relatives who are not part of the family and permanency team;\n(4) evidence that the agency scheduled meetings of the family and permanency team, including meetings relating to the assessment required under section 260C.704, at a time and place convenient for the family;\n(5) evidence that the family and permanency team is involved in the assessment required under section 260C.704 to determine the appropriateness of the child's placement in a qualified residential treatment program;\n(6) the family and permanency team's placement preferences for the child in the assessment required under section 260C.704. When making a decision about the child's placement preferences, the family and permanency team must recognize:\n(i) that the agency should place a child with the child's siblings unless a court finds that placing a child with the child's siblings is not possible due to a child's specialized placement needs or is otherwise contrary to the child's best interests; and\n(ii) that the agency should place an Indian child according to the requirements of the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Minnesota Family Preservation Act under sections 260.751 to 260.835, and section 260C.193, subdivision 3, paragraph (g);\n(7) when reunification of the child with the child's parent or legal guardian is the agency's goal, evidence demonstrating that the parent or legal guardian provided input about the members of the family and permanency team under section 260C.706;\n(8) when the agency's permanency goal is to reunify the child with the child's parent or legal guardian, the out-of-home placement plan must identify services and supports that maintain the parent-child relationship and the parent's legal authority, decision-making, and responsibility for ongoing planning for the child. In addition, the agency must assist the parent with visiting and contacting the child;\n(9) when the agency's permanency goal is to transfer permanent legal and physical custody of the child to a proposed guardian or to finalize the child's adoption, the case plan must document the agency's steps to transfer permanent legal and physical custody of the child or finalize adoption, as required in section 260C.212, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), clauses (6) and (7); and\n(10) the qualified individual's recommendation regarding the child's placement in a qualified residential treatment program and the court approval or disapproval of the placement as required in section 260C.71.\n(b) If the placement preferences of the family and permanency team, child, and tribe, if applicable, are not consistent with the placement setting that the qualified individual recommends, the case plan must include the reasons why the qualified individual did not recommend following the preferences of the family and permanency team, child, and the tribe.\n(c) The agency must file the out-of-home placement plan with the court as part of the 60-day court order under section 260C.71.",
