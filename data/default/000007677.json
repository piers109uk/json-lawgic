The legislature further finds that, as a result of competition in the health care marketplace, these teaching and research institutions are facing increased difficulty funding medical education and research. The purpose of section 62J.692 is to help offset lost patient care revenue for those teaching institutions affected by increased competition in the health care marketplace and to help ensure the continued excellence of health care research in Minnesota.",
