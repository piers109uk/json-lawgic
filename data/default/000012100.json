	"text": "A prosecution for a violation of a rule or regulation shall be brought in the name of the district upon complaint and warrant as in other criminal cases. If the accused is arrested without a warrant, a written complaint shall be made, to which the accused shall be required to plead, and a warrant shall issue on the complaint. The warrant and all other process in such cases shall be directed for service to a police officer, court officer, or sheriff of any of the municipalities in the district.\nIt is a sufficient pleading of the rules and regulations of the district to refer to them by section and number or chapter, or any other way that clearly reflects the rules and regulations that are the subject of the pleading. The rules and regulations shall have the effect of general laws within the district and need not be given in evidence upon the trial of an action.\nAppeals may be taken from the district court in the same manner as from judgments in civil actions.",
