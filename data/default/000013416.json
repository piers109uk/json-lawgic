The order must be calculated to give reasonable notice of the time and place for hearing on the matter, and must state the reasons for the entry of the order. The commissioner of commerce may by order summarily suspend a registration pending final determination of an order to show cause. A hearing on the merits must be held within 30 days of the issuance of the order of summary suspension. All hearings must be conducted under chapter 14. After the hearing, the commissioner of commerce shall enter an order disposing of the matter as the facts require. If the registrant or applicant for registration fails to appear at a hearing after having been duly notified of it, the person shall be considered in default, and the proceeding may be determined against the registrant or applicant for registration upon consideration of the order to show cause, the allegations of which may be considered to be true.",
