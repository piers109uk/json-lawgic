If the donor or other person is physically unable to sign a record, the record may be signed by another individual at the direction of the donor or other person and must:\n(1) be witnessed by at least two adults, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness, who have signed at the request of the donor or the other person; and\n(2) state that it has been signed and witnessed as provided in clause (1).\n(c) Revocation, suspension, expiration, or cancellation of a driver's license or identification card upon which an anatomical gift is indicated does not invalidate the gift.\n(d) An anatomical gift made by will takes effect upon the donor's death whether or not the will is probated. Invalidation of the will after the donor's death does not invalidate the gift.\n(e) The making of an anatomical gift does not authorize or direct a denial of health care.",
