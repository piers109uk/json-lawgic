	"text": "A local emergency may be declared only by the mayor of a municipality or the chair of a county board of commissioners or their legal successors. It may not be continued for a period in excess of three days except by or with the consent of the governing body of the political subdivision. Any order or proclamation declaring, continuing, or terminating a local emergency must be given prompt and general publicity and filed promptly by the chief of the local record-keeping agency of the political subdivision.\nA declaration of a local emergency invokes necessary portions of the response and recovery aspects of applicable local or interjurisdictional disaster plans, and may authorize aid and assistance under those plans.\nNo interjurisdictional agency or official may declare a local emergency unless expressly authorized by the agreement under which the agency functions. However, an interjurisdictional disaster agency shall provide aid and services in accordance with the agreement under which it functions.",
