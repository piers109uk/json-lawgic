In other cases the court shall determine and order child support in a specific dollar amount in accordance with the guidelines and the other factors set forth in section 518A.43 and any departure therefrom. The court may also order the obligor to pay child support in the form of a percentage share of the obligor's net bonuses, commissions, or other forms of compensation, in addition to, or if the obligor receives no base pay, in lieu of, an order for a specific dollar amount.",
