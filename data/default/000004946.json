	"text": "The authority may establish and implement a homestead redemption program under sections 41B.01 to 41B.23. The purpose of the program is to assist persons who have lost their farms due to foreclosure, granting a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or other actions necessary to settle their agricultural debts, and who are otherwise unable to secure the credit necessary to repurchase their farm homestead. The authority may enter into agreements with an eligible lender for the purposes of the program. The authority may, by rule, establish eligibility standards for the program that are different from those established for other programs of the authority. The authority's interest in a homestead redemption loan may not exceed one-half of the loan amount or $25,000, whichever is less.",
