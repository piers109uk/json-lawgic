	"text": "The commissioner of corrections, with the consent of the county board, may designate any suitable jail in the state as a district jail, to be used for the detention of prisoners from other counties in addition to those of its own. If the jail or its management becomes unfit for that purpose, the commissioner may rescind its designation. Whenever there is no sufficient jail in any county, the examining judge, or upon the judge's own motion, upon application of the sheriff, may order any person charged with a criminal offense committed to a sufficient jail in some other county. If there is a district jail in the judicial district, the charged person shall be sent to it, or to any other nearer district jail designated by the judge. The sheriff of the county containing the district jail, on presentation of the order, shall receive, keep in custody, and deliver the charged person up upon the order of the court or a judge.",
