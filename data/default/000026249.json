	"text": "Nothing in this chapter may be construed to preclude a municipality from acquiring the property of a public utility by eminent domain proceedings; provided that damages to be paid in eminent domain proceedings must include the original cost of the property less depreciation, loss of revenue to the utility, expenses resulting from integration of facilities, and other appropriate factors. A municipality seeking to acquire the property of a public utility in eminent domain proceedings may not acquire the right to furnish electric service during the pendency of the proceedings through the use of section 117.042 but may petition the commission under section 216B.44 for service rights. For purposes of this section, a public utility includes a cooperative electric association.",
