	"text": "Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, a unit owner:\n(1) may make any improvements or alterations to the unit that do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium;\n(2) after acquiring an adjoining unit or an adjoining part of an adjoining unit, may with consent of the association and first mortgagees of the affected units, remove or alter any intervening partition or create apertures therein, even if the partition in whole or in part is a common element, if those acts do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium. The adjoining unit owners shall have the exclusive license to use the space occupied by the common elements, but the use shall not create an easement or vested right. Removal of partitions or creation of apertures under this paragraph is not an alteration of boundaries. The association may reasonably require that the owner or owners of units affected replace or restore any such partition.",
