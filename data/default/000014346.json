The municipality shall pay an amount of the project costs equal to at least 12 percent of the cleanup costs from the municipality's general fund, a property tax levy for that purpose, or other unrestricted money available to the municipality (excluding tax increments). These unrestricted moneys may be spent for project costs, other than cleanup costs, and qualify for the local match payment equal to 12 percent of cleanup costs. The rest of the local match may be paid with tax increments, regional, state, or federal money available for the redevelopment of brownfields or any other money available to the municipality.",
