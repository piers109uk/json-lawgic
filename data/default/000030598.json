If a man has been identified as a possible father of the child, the court may, and upon request of a party shall, require the child, the mother, and the man to submit to appropriate tests; and\n(5) all other evidence relevant to the issue of paternity of the child.\nUpon refusal of a witness, including a party, to testify under oath or produce evidence, the court may order the party to testify under oath and produce evidence concerning all relevant facts. No testimony or other information compelled under the order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information, may be used against the witness in any criminal case, except for perjury committed in the testimony. The refusal of a witness, who has been granted immunity, to obey an order to testify or produce evidence is subject to the sanctions within the jurisdiction of the court.\nTestimony of a physician, an advanced practice registered nurse, or a physician assistant concerning the medical circumstances of the pregnancy itself and the condition and characteristics of the child upon birth is not privileged.",
