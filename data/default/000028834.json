	"text": "If the patient is entitled to care by any agency of the United States in this state, the commitment warrant shall be in triplicate, committing the patient to the joint custody of the head of the treatment facility, state-operated treatment program, or community-based treatment program and the federal agency. If the federal agency is unable or unwilling to receive the patient at the time of commitment, the patient may subsequently be transferred to it upon its request.\nAny person, when admitted to an institution of a federal agency within or without this state, shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the federal agency, except that nothing in this section shall deprive any person of rights secured to patients of state-operated treatment programs, treatment facilities, and community-based treatment programs by this chapter.\nThe chief officer of any treatment facility operated by a federal agency to which any person is admitted shall have the same powers as the heads of state-operated treatment programs within this state with respect to admission, retention of custody, transfer, parole, or discharge of the committed person.\nThe judgment or order of commitment by a court of competent jurisdiction of another state committing a person to a federal agency for care or treatment in this state, shall have the same force and effect as to the committed person while in this state as in the jurisdiction in which is situated the court entering the judgment or making the order. The committing state consents to the authority of the chief officer of any treatment facility of a federal agency in this state, to retain custody of, transfer, parole, or discharge the committed person.\n[Repealed, 1997 c 217 art 1 s 118]",
