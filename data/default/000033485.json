	"text": "Reimbursement shall equal economic loss except that:\n(1) reimbursement shall be reduced to the extent that economic loss is recouped from a collateral source or collateral sources. Where compensation is readily available to a claimant from a collateral source, the claimant must take reasonable steps to recoup from the collateral source before claiming reimbursement;\n(2) reimbursement shall be denied or reduced to the extent, if any, that the board deems reasonable because of the contributory misconduct of the claimant or of a victim through whom the claimant claims. Contributory misconduct does not include current or past affiliation with any particular group; and\n(3) reimbursement paid to all claimants suffering economic loss as the result of the injury or death of any one victim shall not exceed $50,000.\nNo employer may deny an employee an award of benefits based on the employee's eligibility or potential eligibility for reimbursement.",
