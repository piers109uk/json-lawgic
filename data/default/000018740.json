A payment issued from federal funds under title XX of the Social Security Act, state funds under the Vulnerable Children and Adults Act, federal or state child welfare funds, or county funds in a payment month must not restrict MFIP eligibility or reduce the monthly assistance payment for that participant.\n(a) An individual whose needs have been otherwise provided for in another state, in whole or in part by county, state, or federal dollars during a month, is ineligible to receive MFIP for the month.\n(b) A county agency must not count an applicant or participant as a member of more than one assistance unit in this state in a given payment month, except as provided in clauses (1) and (2).\n(1) A participant who is a member of an assistance unit is eligible to be included in a second assistance unit the month after the month the participant joins the second unit.\n(2) An applicant whose needs are met through federal, state, or local foster care payments for the first part of an application month is eligible to receive assistance for the remaining part of the month in which the applicant returns home. Foster care payments must be considered prorated payments rather than a duplication of MFIP need.\nFor any month an individual receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, the individual is not eligible for the MFIP food portion of assistance, except as provided under section 142G.19, subdivision 4.",
