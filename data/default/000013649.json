	"text": "The legislature recognizes that acid deposition substantially resulting from the conduct of commercial and industrial operations, both within and without the state, poses a present and severe danger to the delicate balance of ecological systems within the state, and that the failure to act promptly and decisively to mitigate or eliminate this danger will soon result in untold and irreparable damage to the agricultural, water, forest, fish, and wildlife resources of the state. It is therefore the intent of the legislature in enacting sections 116.42 to 116.44 to mitigate or eliminate the acid deposition problem by curbing sources of acid deposition within the state and to support and encourage other states, the federal government, and the province of Ontario in recognizing the dangers of acid deposition and taking steps to mitigate or eliminate it within their own jurisdictions.",
