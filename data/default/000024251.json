The city may acquire property for the purposes of this section pursuant to chapter 117. General obligation bonds may be issued pursuant to chapter 475 except as provided in this section for the acquisition, construction, or improvement in an amount that does not exceed the value of the commission's investment in the armory property. Before issuance of bonds, the city shall give three weeks' published notice. If a number of voters in the city equal to ten percent of those who voted for candidates for governor at the last gubernatorial election present a petition within six weeks of the first published notice to the city clerk requesting that the matter be submitted to popular vote, it shall be submitted at the next regular election.\nIf a majority of those voting on the question approve it or if no petition is presented within the prescribed time, the city may issue the bonds and levy a tax for the purpose of this section in accordance with section 475.61.
