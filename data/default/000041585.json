In all counties except any county having a population of more than 150,000, each warrant shall be so drawn that when signed by the treasurer in an appropriate place, it becomes a check on the county depository. If in payment for services, the specific time for which the same were rendered shall be therein stated, and all orders and warrants shall be progressively numbered, and the number, date, and amount of each, the name of the person to whom payable, and the specific time for which any service was rendered, shall, at the time of issuing the same, be entered in a book to be kept by the auditor for that purpose.",
