	"text": "If a group long-term care policy is replaced by another group long-term care policy issued to the same policyholder, the succeeding insurer shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the previous group policy on its date of termination. Coverage provided or offered to individuals by the insurer and premiums charged to persons under the new group policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced and shall not vary or otherwise depend on the individual's health or disability status, claim experience, or use of long-term care services.\n(a) The premiums charged to an insured for long-term care insurance replaced under subdivision 1 shall not increase due to either the increasing age of the insured at ages beyond 65 or the duration the insured has been covered under this policy.\n(b) The purchase of additional coverage must not be considered a premium rate increase, but for purposes of the calculation required under section 62S.291, the portion of the premium attributable to the additional coverage must be added to and considered part of the initial annual premium.\n(c) A reduction in benefits must not be considered a premium change, but for purpose of the calculation required under section 62S.291, the initial annual premium must be based on the reduced benefits.",
