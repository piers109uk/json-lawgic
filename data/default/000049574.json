When so assembled, such judges may revise and amend such rules as they deem expedient, conformably to law, and the same shall take effect from and after the publication thereof. Such rules, as the same shall be so revised and amended from time to time, shall govern all the district courts of the state; but, in furtherance of justice, they may be relaxed or modified in any case, or a party relieved from the effect thereof, on such terms as may be just.
