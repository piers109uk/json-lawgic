A purchaser of units in this common interest community should consider the possible effects of the declarant's rights reserved for this project\"; and\n(2) the disclosure statement shall include, in addition to the information required by section 515B.4-102, a statement referencing the provisions of the declaration where rights to add additional real estate are reserved.",
