	"text": "(a) Within 30 days after the renewal date, a licensee who has not renewed their license must be notified by letter, sent to the last known address of the licensee in the board's file, that the renewal is overdue and that failure to pay the current fee and current biennial renewal late fee within 60 days after the renewal date will result in termination of the license.\n(b) The board must terminate the license of a licensee whose license renewal is at least 60 days overdue and to whom notification has been sent as provided in paragraph (a). Failure of a licensee to receive notification is not grounds for later challenge of the termination. The former licensee must be notified of the termination by letter within seven days after board action, in the same manner as provided in paragraph (a).\n(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the board retains jurisdiction over a former licensee for complaints received after termination of a license regarding conduct that occurred during licensure.",
