	"text": "Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a state agency as defined in section 16B.01, subdivision 2, with the approval of the governor, may waive fees that would otherwise be charged for agency services. The waiver of fees must be confined to geographic areas within a presidentially declared disaster area, and to the minimum periods of time necessary to deal with the emergency situation. The requirements of sections 14.055 and 14.056 do not apply to a waiver made under this section. The agency must promptly report the reasons for and the impact of any suspended fees to the chairs of the legislative committees that oversee the policy and budgetary affairs of the agency.",
