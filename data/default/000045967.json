	"text": "Subject to sections 179A.01 to 179A.25 and sections 177.41 to 177.44 but notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, every political subdivision of this state shall establish equitable compensation relationships between female-dominated, male-dominated, and balanced classes of employees in order to eliminate sex-based wage disparities in public employment in this state. A primary consideration in negotiating, establishing, recommending, and approving compensation is comparable work value in relationship to other employee positions within the political subdivision. This law may not be construed to limit the ability of the parties to collectively bargain in good faith.\nIn all interest arbitration involving a class other than a balanced class held under sections 179A.01 to 179A.25, the arbitrator shall consider the equitable compensation relationship standards established in this section and the standards established under section 471.993, together with other standards appropriate to interest arbitration. The arbitrator shall consider both the results of a job evaluation study and any employee objections to the study. In interest arbitration for a balanced class, the arbitrator may consider the standards established under this section and the results of, and any employee objections to, a job evaluation study, but shall also consider similar or like classifications in other political subdivisions.\nMS 1988 [Repealed, 1990 c 512 s 13]\nIn collective bargaining for a balanced class, the parties may consider the equitable compensation relationship standards established by this section and the results of a job evaluation study, but shall also consider similar or like classifications in other political subdivisions.",
