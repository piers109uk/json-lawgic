	"text": "The board of county commissioners of any county is hereby authorized to establish a system of licensing and regulating the running at large of dogs, except in cities of the first class, and create a livestock indemnity fund to be handled and disbursed as hereinafter provided.\nBefore regulating and licensing, there must be filed with the county auditor a petition signed by at least 25 percent of the persons actually engaged in raising livestock, including poultry, in the county, as shown by the assessors' records, requesting the board to establish such system. When the petition has been filed the board of county commissioners shall establish such system; or the board of county commissioners may, by a majority vote, on their own motion and without petition, establish such system. The board of county commissioners shall exclude from the operation of sections 347.08 to 347.21, statutory cities, second, third, and fourth class cities if such city has in operation a satisfactory law regulating dogs running at large.\nAt any time after such system has been in effect for a period of two years from the date of its establishment, it may be revoked by a majority vote of the board of county commissioners, but provided that before such revocation the board shall hold a public hearing and give at least ten days' notice of such hearing by publication in at least one newspaper published or circulating in the county.",
