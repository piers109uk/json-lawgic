The payroll shall be in such forms and supported by such records as the state auditor prescribes. It shall contain the name and rate of pay of each claimant together with the total amount of each claim.\nThe payroll shall be prepared by the county engineer either monthly or semimonthly as directed by the county board. The county highway engineer shall certify it as being true and correct and shall present it to the county auditor for payment. It shall thereupon be lawful for the county auditor and county treasurer to pay the claims as set forth in the payroll without allowance therefor by the county board. Upon presentation to the county auditor of the payroll, the auditor shall forthwith issue to the several claimants whose names appear therein a warrant in payment of their respective claims.",
