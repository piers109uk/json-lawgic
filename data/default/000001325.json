	"text": "A political committee, political fund, principal campaign committee, or party unit may terminate its registration with the board after it has disposed of all its assets in excess of $100 by filing a final report of receipts and expenditures. The final report must be identified as a termination report and must include all financial transactions that occurred after the last date included on the most recent report filed with the board. The termination report may be filed at any time after the asset threshold in this section is reached.\n\"Assets\" include credit balances at vendors, prepaid postage and postage stamps, as well as physical assets. Assets must be disposed of at their fair market value. Assets of a political fund that consist of, or were acquired using, only the general treasury money of the fund's supporting association remain the property of the association upon termination of the association's political fund registration and are not subject to the disposal requirements of this section.",
