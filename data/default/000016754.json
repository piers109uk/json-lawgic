	"text": "The healthy kids awards program is established to reward kindergarten through grade 12 schools that implement policies and practices that create opportunities for students to be physically active and make healthy food choices throughout the day. The program seeks to integrate physical activity into nonphysical education classes, recess, and extracurricular activities throughout the day in addition to the physical education received in physical education classes. The program also seeks to integrate nutrition education and healthy food and beverage choices throughout the school environment, including classrooms, cafeteria, vending, school stores, and fundraising. The program requirements align with the Institute of Medicine's guidelines for school food and beverages.\nSchool districts may submit letters of intent to participate in the healthy kids awards program to the commissioner of education by September 15 of each school year. Schools that report to the commissioner of education and meet the program criteria developed by the commissioner will have a \"Healthy Kids Award\" indicator placed on the school report card.",
