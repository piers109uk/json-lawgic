	"text": "A law enforcement officer shall make a diligent effort to determine whether any disabled person found is a person having epilepsy or a diabetic, or suffers from some other type of illness that would cause the condition. Whenever feasible, this effort shall be made before the person is charged with a crime or taken to a place of detention.\nIn seeking to determine whether a disabled person suffers from an illness, a law enforcement officer shall make a reasonable search for an identifying device and an identification card of the type described in section 145.852, subdivision 2, and examine them for emergency information. The law enforcement officer may not search for an identifying device or an identification card in a manner or to an extent that would appear to a reasonable person in the circumstances to cause an unreasonable risk of worsening the disabled person's condition. The law enforcement officer may not remove an identifying device or an identification card from the possession of a disabled person unless the removal is necessary for law enforcement purposes or to protect the safety of the disabled person.\nA law enforcement officer who finds a disabled person without an identifying device or identification card is not relieved of the duty to that person to make a diligent effort to ascertain the existence of any illness causing the disabled condition.\nA cause of action against a law enforcement officer does not arise from the officer's making a reasonable search of the disabled person to locate an identifying device or identification card, even though the person is not wearing an identifying device or carrying an identification card.\nA law enforcement officer who determines or has reason to believe that a disabled person is suffering from an illness causing the person's condition shall promptly notify the person's physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant, if practicable. If the officer is unable to ascertain the physician's, advanced practice registered nurse's, or physician assistant's identity or to communicate with the physician, advanced practice registered nurse, or physician assistant, the officer shall make a reasonable effort to cause the disabled person to be transported immediately to a medical practitioner or to a facility where medical treatment is available. If the officer believes it unduly dangerous to move the disabled person, the officer shall make a reasonable effort to obtain the assistance of a medical practitioner.",
