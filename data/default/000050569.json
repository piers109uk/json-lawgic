	"text": "When the estate of a tenant for life or for years in the whole or any part of the property has been proved or admitted to exist at the time of the order for sale, and the person entitled thereto has been made a party, such estate may first be set off out of any part of the property, and a sale made of such part subject to such estate; but if, in the judgment of the court, a due regard to the interest of all parties requires that such estate be sold, the sale may be so ordered. If a sale of the property including such estate is ordered, such estate passes thereby, and the purchaser, the purchaser's heirs and assigns, shall hold the property discharged from all claim by virtue thereof, whether the same relate to the undivided share of a joint tenant or tenant in common, or to the whole or any part of the property sold.",
