	"text": "Every able-bodied male prisoner over 16 years of age confined in any county jail or statutory city lockup under judgment of any court or other tribunal authorized to imprison for the violation of any law, ordinance, bylaw, or police regulation may be required to work for not more than ten hours per day. The court or tribunal, when passing judgment of imprisonment for nonpayment of fine or otherwise, shall determine and specify whether or not the imprisonment shall be at hard labor. The labor may be in the jail or jail yard, upon public roads and streets, public buildings, grounds, or elsewhere in the county. Upon request, persons awaiting trial may be allowed to perform labor. Each prisoner performing labor may be paid a reasonable compensation by the county if imprisoned in violation of state law or awaiting trial upon a charge thereof, and by the city if confined for the violation of any ordinance, bylaw, or police regulation. The compensation shall be paid to the spouse, family, or dependents of the prisoner, or any other person the court sentencing the prisoner directs. It shall be in an amount that the court determines. It shall be allowed by the board of county commissioners or the governing body of the city upon order of the court.",
