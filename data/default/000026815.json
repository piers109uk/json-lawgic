	"text": "If a warehouse operator or household goods warehouse operator fails to obey any law of this state or any order of the department, the department may, upon verified petition alleging such failure, apply to the district court of the county in which the operator's principal place of business is located for the enforcement of such law or order or other appropriate relief. The court, upon such notice as it may direct, shall hear such matter as in case of an appeal from an order. On the hearing, the findings of fact upon which the order is based shall be prima facie evidence of the merits therein stated, and the court may grant any provisional or other relief, ordinary or extraordinary, legal or equitable, which the nature of the case may require, and may impose a fine of not more than $50 for each day's failure to obey any writ, process, or order of the court, in addition to all other penalties or forfeitures provided by law. A temporary mandatory or restraining order may be made in such proceedings, notwithstanding any undetermined issue of fact, upon such terms as to security as the court may direct.",
