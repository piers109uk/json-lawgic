	"text": "Except as provided in subdivision 2, no person may sell, barter, give away, or otherwise dispose of or introduce, have, or keep for barter, gift, or sale, any intoxicating liquors of any kind upon the State Fairgrounds, or aid and abet any of those acts. The presence and possession of any kind of these liquors, in any quantity, upon the person or upon the premises leased or occupied by any person within these limits is a public nuisance and is prima facie evidence of the purpose of the person to barter, give away, or sell the liquor. Any person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\nThe following exceptions apply:\n(1) The State Agricultural Society may issue, under terms and conditions it chooses, licenses for the sale, possession, and consumption of intoxicating liquors at special events taking place on the fairgrounds at times other than during the annual fair including, but not limited to, family reunions, class reunions, weddings, conventions, and similar events.\n(2) The State Agricultural Society may issue, under terms and conditions it chooses, consistent with state law, licenses for the sale, possession, and consumption of intoxicating malt liquors during the annual fair or at other times of their choosing, provided that at least one Minnesota brewed malt liquor is made available for sale at each allowed location within the grounds.\n(3) The State Agricultural Society may issue a license for the sale and consumption of wine to a holder of a state fair concession's contract with the State Agricultural Society which authorizes the licensee to sell Minnesota-produced wine by the glass at the state fair in connection with the sale of food by the concessionaire. For the purposes of this subdivision, \"Minnesota-produced wine\" means wine produced by a farm winery licensed under section 340A.315.",
