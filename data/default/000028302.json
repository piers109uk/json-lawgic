The effectiveness of the response protocol must be reviewed and documented.\nIf a license holder uses monitoring technology in a community residential setting, the license holder must obtain a signed informed consent form from each resident served by the program or the resident's legal representative documenting the resident's or legal representative's agreement to use of the specific monitoring technology used in the setting. The informed consent form documenting this agreement must also explain:\n(1) how the license holder uses monitoring technology to provide remote supervision;\n(2) the risks and benefits of using monitoring technology;\n(3) how the license holder protects each resident's privacy while monitoring technology is being used in the setting; and\n(4) how the license holder protects each resident's privacy when the monitoring technology system electronically records personally identifying data.",
