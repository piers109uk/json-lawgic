	"text": "A creditor that is notified of the initial mediation meeting is subject to and bound by a mediation agreement if the creditor does not attend mediation meetings unless the creditor files a claim form. In lieu of attending a mediation meeting, a creditor may file a notice of claim and proof of claim on a claim form with the mediator before the scheduled meeting. By filing a claim form the creditor agrees to be bound by a mediation agreement reached at the mediation meeting unless an objection is filed within the time specified. The mediator must notify the creditors who have filed claim forms of the terms of any agreement.\nA creditor who has filed a claim form may serve a written objection to the terms of the agreement on the mediator and the debtor within ten days after receiving notice of the agreement. If a creditor files an objection to the terms of an agreement, the mediator shall meet again with debtors and creditors within ten days after receiving the objection to mediate a new agreement. Notwithstanding the mediation period under section 583.26, subdivision 8, if an objection is filed, the mediator shall call mediation meetings during the ten-day period following receipt of the objection.",
