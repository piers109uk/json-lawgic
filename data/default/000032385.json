Interest does not apply to the 30-day period.\n(b) In the case of an erroneous refund, interest accrues from the date the refund was paid unless the erroneous refund results from a mistake of the Department of Revenue or the county, then no interest or penalty is imposed unless the deficiency assessment is not satisfied within 60 days of the order.\nNotwithstanding section 549.09, if judgment is entered in favor of the commissioner of revenue or a county with regard to any tax under this chapter, the judgment bears interest at the rate specified in section 270C.40 from the date the judgment is entered until the date of payment.\nA penalty imposed under this chapter bears interest from the date provided in section 270C.40, subdivision 3, to the date of payment of the penalty.",
