	"text": "A resident of a Minnesota veterans home has the right to complain and otherwise exercise freedom of expression and assembly which is guaranteed by amendment I of the United States Constitution. The administrator of the home shall inform each resident in writing at the time of admission of the right to complain to the administrator about home accommodations and services. A notice of the right to complain shall be posted in the home. The administrator shall also inform each resident of the right to complain to the commissioner of veterans affairs. Each resident of a home shall be encouraged and assisted, throughout the period of stay in the home, to understand and exercise the rights of freedom of expression and assembly as a resident and as a citizen, and, to this end, the resident may voice grievances and recommend changes in policies and services to home staff, other residents, and outside representatives of the resident's choice, free from restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination, or reprisal, including retaliatory eviction.\nAn administrator may not retaliate against any resident who exercises the right to voice grievances by evicting the resident. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any eviction within 45 days of the exercise by a resident of the right to voice grievances is retaliatory. This presumption does not apply in favor of a resident who has failed to pay maintenance fees unless the resident pays the overdue fees.",
