The commissioner of corrections shall reimburse local social services agencies for foster care costs they incur for the child while on probation or parole to the extent that funds for this purpose are made available to the commissioner by the legislature. The juvenile court may order the parents of a child on probation or parole to pay the costs of foster care under section 260B.331, subdivision 1, if the local social services agency has determined that requiring reimbursement is in the child's best interests, according to their ability to pay, and to the extent that the commissioner of corrections has not reimbursed the local social services agency.\nThe written order of the commissioner of corrections is authority to any peace officer or parole or probation officer to take and detain any child committed to the commissioner of corrections by a juvenile court who absconds from field supervision or escapes from confinement, violates furlough conditions, or is released from court while on institution status. Any person of the age of 18 years or older who is taken into custody under the provisions of this subdivision may be detained as provided in section 260B.181, subdivision 4.",
