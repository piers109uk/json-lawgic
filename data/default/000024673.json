	"text": "A Voting Rights Act cost sharing account is established in the special revenue fund. Money in the account is appropriated to the secretary of state for the purpose of reimbursing political subdivisions for presuit notice cost sharing expenses agreed to under section 200.56, subdivision 4, as authorized by this section. The secretary of state may retain up to five percent of the total cost of a reimbursement for administrative costs associated with processing the reimbursement.\n(a) A political subdivision that implements a remedy in response to a presuit notice letter submitted under section 200.56 and pays a cost sharing amount under that section may apply to the secretary of state for reimbursement of the paid amount.\n(b) The secretary of state must establish a form to be used by a political subdivision when applying for the reimbursement. The secretary of state must approve a submitted application, so long as the information provided by the political subdivision demonstrates that the expenses paid are eligible under section 200.56 and that sufficient funds are available in the Voting Rights Act cost sharing account to make the reimbursement payment. The secretary of state must review, approve, and distribute a reimbursement to an eligible political subdivision within 45 days of receiving its application.",
