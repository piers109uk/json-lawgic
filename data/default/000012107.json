	"text": "If the drainage authority finds that constructing a private road would be more cost-effective or practical than constructing a bridge or culvert, the drainage authority may order that a private road be constructed. The private road must be constructed and maintained in the same manner as a bridge or culvert. The private road must be constructed in a manner suitable for farm vehicles but may not have a right-of-way wider than 33 feet. The drainage authority has jurisdiction over the land required for the private road and the road is part of the drainage system.",
