	"text": "As of January 1, 1990, if a county has not submitted a proposed agricultural land preservation plan and proposed official controls to the commissioner and the regional development commission, if one exists, a municipality within the county may request by resolution that the county submit a plan and official controls to the commissioner and the regional development commission. If the county does not do so within one year of receipt of the resolution, the municipality may perform the duties of the county with respect to land under its jurisdiction.\nNothing in this chapter limits a municipality's power to plan or adopt official controls under other laws or to adopt official controls that are consistent with or more restrictive than those enacted by the county.\nMunicipalities shall revise existing plans and official controls to conform with the county approved agricultural land preservation plan and official controls and shall initiate implementation of the revised plans and controls within one year after receiving the county approved agricultural land preservation plan and controls.",
