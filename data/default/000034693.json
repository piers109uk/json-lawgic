	"text": "An action required or permitted to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders may be taken without a meeting by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by all of the shareholders entitled to vote on that action. The articles of a corporation that is not a publicly held corporation may provide that any action may be taken by written action signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by shareholders having voting power equal to the voting power that would be required to take the same action at a meeting of the shareholders at which all shareholders were present, but in no event may written action be taken by holders of less than a majority of the voting power of all shares entitled to vote on that action. After the adoption of the initial articles, an amendment to the articles to permit written action to be taken by less than all shareholders requires the approval of all of the shareholders entitled to vote on the amendment.\nThe written action is effective when it has been signed, or consented to by authenticated electronic communication, by the required shareholders, unless a different effective time is provided in the written action.\nWhen written action is permitted to be taken by less than all shareholders, all shareholders who did not sign or consent to the written action must be notified of its text and effective time no later than five days after the effective time of the action. Failure to provide the notice does not invalidate the written action. A shareholder who does not sign or consent to the written action has no liability for any action authorized by the written action.",
