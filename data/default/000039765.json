The notice must include:\n(1) an explanation that the plan is converting from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan, including definitions of those terms, on the conversion effective date and that the active and former volunteer firefighters will become fully vested in their accrued benefit as of the conversion effective date;\n(2) a summary of the terms of the defined contribution plan;\n(3) a section tailored to each volunteer firefighter that provides an estimate of the present value of the participant's fully vested accrued benefit and the calculation that resulted in that value;\n(4) an estimate of any anticipated surplus and an explanation of the allocation of the surplus; and\n(5) contact information for the chief administrative officer or chief financial officer of the participating employer and the designated staff member of the retirement plan who will answer questions and directions to a website.\n(a) On the conversion effective date, each active or former volunteer firefighter with a retirement benefit under the defined benefit plan, except any retiree in pay status who is receiving a monthly benefit, becomes 100 percent vested as of the conversion effective date in the firefighter's retirement benefit, without regard to the number of years of vesting service credit.\n(b) The executive director must determine the present value of each active or former firefighter's accrued benefit as of the conversion effective date, taking into account the full vesting requirement under paragraph (a).\nIf the fire department account has a surplus over full funding, as defined under section 353G.08, subdivision 1, paragraph (c), the executive director must allocate the surplus over full funding to the individual account of each active and former volunteer firefighter, except any former volunteer firefighter receiving an annuity, in the same proportion that the volunteer firefighter's accrued benefit bears to the total accrued benefits of all active and former volunteer firefighters.\n(a) If any former volunteer firefighter or beneficiary is receiving an annuity, the executive director must determine the present value of the remaining payments to the former volunteer firefighter or beneficiary and offer the former volunteer firefighter or beneficiary:\n(1) continued payments in the same monthly amount; or\n(2) an immediate lump-sum distribution of the present value amount.\n(b) The offer of an immediate lump-sum distribution must include an offer to the former volunteer firefighter or beneficiary to elect a direct rollover of the amount to an eligible retirement plan as permitted under section 356.633, subdivisions 1 and 2, if the distribution is an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section 356.633 subdivision 1, paragraph (d).\nIn no event may the value of a volunteer firefighter's individual account in the defined contribution plan be less as of the day following the conversion effective date than the present value of the volunteer firefighter's accrued benefit as of the day before the conversion effective date.",
