If the board decides that there is not an important question of water policy, the board may not intervene and the proceeding continues in the agency as though the petition had not been made. If the board decides there is an important question of water policy and intervention in the public interest is justified, the board must issue a brief statement to the petitioner and the agency describing in general terms the questions of water policy it will consider.",
