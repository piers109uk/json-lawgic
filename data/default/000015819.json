Schoolwide implementation of PBIS requires training, coaching, and evaluation for school staff to consistently implement the key components that make PBIS effective for all students, including:\n(1) establishing, defining, teaching, and practicing three to five positively stated schoolwide behavioral expectations that are representative of the local community and cultures;\n(2) developing and implementing a consistent system used by all staff to provide positive feedback and acknowledgment for students who display schoolwide behavioral expectations;\n(3) developing and implementing a consistent and specialized support system for students who do not display behaviors representative of schoolwide positive expectations;\n(4) developing a system to support decisions based on data related to student progress, effective implementation of behavioral practices, and screening for students requiring additional behavior supports;\n(5) using a continuum of evidence-based interventions that is integrated and aligned to support academic and behavioral success for all students; and\n(6) using a team-based approach to support effective implementation, monitor progress, and evaluate outcomes.\nConsistent with section 120B.232, subdivision 1, character education curriculum and programs may be used to support implementation of the key components of PBIS.",
