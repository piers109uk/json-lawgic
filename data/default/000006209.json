The notice or advice shall contain the amount of the additional premium, the down payment collected by the insurer or agent, if any, and the amount of premium to be added to the insurance premium finance agreement.\n(c) If the additional premiums to be added to the insurance premium finance agreement result from additional premiums required on policies presently financed under the agreement or from a renewal of a policy or from other policies owned or purchased by the insured, a written notice must be mailed, faxed, or delivered to the insured outlining any changes to the information required by subdivision 1 along with a conspicuous statement to the insured that the insured may tender the premiums in full or affirm the proposed changes by tendering either an additional down payment or tendering the proposed revised installment amount, or disaffirm the financing of the additional premium by continuing the original payment amount as agreed to in the initial agreement.\nIf the proposed revisions in paragraph (c) are affirmed by the insured, the finance company may make an additional finance charge according to section 59A.09 for the additional premium financed and added to the open-end agreement; however, no additional flat service fee may be made or charged for adding additional or subsequent premiums to an open-end insurance premium finance agreement for which a flat service fee was previously made or charged.\nThe premium finance company or the insurance agent shall deliver to the insured, or mail to the insured at the address shown in the agreement, a completed copy of that agreement. Within 15 days of receiving the policy number of the policy being financed, the premium finance company shall mail to the insurer a notice of financed premium, which contains the term, amount of premium, and type of policy being financed.\nNo insurance agent, insurance broker, or insurer may require a person to use a particular insurance premium finance company or other installment payment plan for which a finance charge or other fee in connection with an installment payment has been or will be imposed or refuse to accept premium payment from a company licensed under sections 59A.01 to 59A.15.",
