	"text": "An assessment for a tax obligor not possessing valid stamps or other official indicia showing that the tax has been paid shall be considered a jeopardy assessment or collection, as provided in section 270C.36. The commissioner shall assess a tax and applicable penalties based on personal knowledge or information available to the commissioner; mail the taxpayer at the taxpayer's last known address or serve in person, a written notice of the amount of tax and penalty; demand its immediate payment; and, if payment is not immediately made, collect the tax and penalty by any method prescribed in chapter 270C, except that the commissioner need not await the expiration of the times specified in chapter 270C.\nNo person may bring suit to enjoin the assessment or collection of any taxes, interest, or penalties imposed by this chapter.\nThe tax and penalties assessed by the commissioner are presumed to be valid and correctly determined and assessed. The burden is upon the taxpayer to show their incorrectness or invalidity. Any statement filed by the commissioner with the court administrator, or any other certificate by the commissioner of the amount of tax and penalties determined or assessed is admissible in evidence and is prima facie evidence of the facts it contains.",
