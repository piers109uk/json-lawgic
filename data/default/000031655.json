	"text": "The county assessor shall examine the assessment appraisal records of each local assessor anytime after December 1 of each year and shall immediately give notice in writing to the governing body of said district of any deficiencies in the assessment procedures with respect to the quantity of or quality of the work done as of that date and indicating corrective measures to be undertaken and effected by the local assessor not later than 30 days thereafter. If, upon reexamination of such records at that time, the deficiencies noted in the written notice previously given have not been substantially corrected to the end that a timely and uniform assessment of all real property in the county will be attained, then the county assessor with the approval of the county board shall collect the necessary records from the local assessor and complete the assessment or employ others to complete the assessment. When the county assessor has completed the assessments, the local assessor shall thereafter resume the assessment function within the district. In this circumstance the cost of completing the assessment shall be charged against the assessment district involved. The county auditor shall certify the costs thus incurred to the appropriate governing body not later than August 1 and if unpaid as of September 1 of the assessment year, the county auditor shall levy a tax upon the taxable property of said assessment district sufficient to pay such costs. The amount so collected shall be credited to the general revenue fund of the county.",
