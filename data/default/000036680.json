	"text": "Any violation of section 325G.31 is a violation of a law under section 8.31, subdivision 1. The remedies provided in section 8.31, subdivisions 3 and 3a, are limited as provided in section 325G.34.\nIn addition to the remedies provided in section 8.31, a court reviewing a consumer contract may reform or limit a provision so as to avoid an unfair result if it finds that:\n(1) a material provision of the contract violates section 325G.31;\n(2) the violation caused the consumer to be substantially confused about any of the rights, obligations or remedies of the contract; and\n(3) the violation has caused or is likely to cause financial detriment to the consumer.\nIf the court reforms or limits a provision of a consumer contract, the court shall also make orders necessary to avoid unjust enrichment. Bringing a claim for relief pursuant to this subdivision does not entitle a consumer to withhold performance of an otherwise valid contractual obligation. No relief shall be granted pursuant to this subdivision unless the claim is brought before the obligations of the contract have been fully performed.",
