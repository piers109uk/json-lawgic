No depository shall deposit United States government bonds which mature within one year from the date such bonds were first considered as a part of the bank's reserve and which reserves are required by section 48.221. The council of each city shall, at all times, designate depositories in the city, or elsewhere in the United States, sufficient for the depository of all funds which are likely to be in the hands of the treasurer of the city at any one time and shall, so far as consistent with the best interest of the city, designate these depositories in the city and require from these depositories good and sufficient bonds payable to the city in a penal sum not to exceed the amount designated as the limit of deposit therein, and conditioned for the safekeeping and payment of funds so deposited, or, in lieu thereof, good and sufficient collateral as provided for by section 118A.03.",
