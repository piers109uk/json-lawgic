	"text": "(a) Directors are elected or appointed and hold office for fixed terms provided for in the articles or bylaws. A term of a director, other than an ex officio director, may not exceed ten years. If the articles or bylaws do not provide for a fixed term, the term is one year. An ex officio director serves as long as the director holds the office or position designated in the articles or bylaws.\n(b) Unless the articles or bylaws provide otherwise, a director holds office until expiration of the term for which the director was elected or appointed and until a successor is elected and qualified, or until the earlier death, resignation, removal, or disqualification of the director.\n(c) A decrease in the number of directors or term of office does not shorten an incumbent director's term.\n(d) Except as provided in the articles or bylaws, the term of a director filling a vacancy expires at the end of the unexpired term that the director is filling.\nThe articles or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into groups. The terms of office of the groups need not be uniform.",
