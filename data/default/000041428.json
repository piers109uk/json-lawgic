	"title": "383A.601 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.",
	"text": "The legislature finds that the lands and waters of Ramsey County are great natural resources; that as a result of erosion of lands and sediment deposition in waters of the region, waters are being polluted and despoiled to a degree that fish, aquatic life, recreation, and other uses of lands and waters are being adversely affected; that the rapid shift in land use from agricultural to nonagricultural uses has accelerated the processes of soil erosion and sedimentation. Implementation of the Metropolitan Surface Water Planning Act in Ramsey County requires a coordinated effort in that county, and the state of Minnesota may benefit from a pilot program within that county. The legislature further finds it is necessary to establish and implement through the soil and water conservation district in cooperation with water management organizations, cities, towns, and other public and private entities in that county, a countywide coordinated erosion and sediment control pilot program to conserve and to protect the land, water, and other natural resources of Ramsey County.",
