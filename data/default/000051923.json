	"text": "(a) The court, in determining whether to order restitution and the amount of the restitution, shall consider the following factors:\n(1) the amount of economic loss sustained by the victim as a result of the offense; and\n(2) the income, resources, and obligations of the defendant.\n(b) If there is more than one victim of a crime, the court shall give priority to victims who are not governmental entities when ordering restitution.\nThe presentence investigation report made pursuant to section 609.115, subdivision 1, must contain information pertaining to the factors set forth in subdivision 1.\nThe court shall include in every restitution order a provision requiring a payment schedule or structure. The court may assign the responsibility for developing the schedule or structure to the court administrator, a probation officer, or another designated person. The person who develops the payment schedule or structure shall consider relevant information supplied by the defendant. If the defendant is placed on supervised probation, the payment schedule or structure must be incorporated into the probation agreement and must provide that the obligation to pay restitution continues throughout the term of probation. If the defendant is not placed on probation, the structure or schedule must provide that the obligation to pay restitution begins no later than 60 days after the restitution order is issued.\n(a) At the sentencing, dispositional hearing, or hearing on the restitution request, the offender shall have the burden to produce evidence if the offender intends to challenge the amount of restitution or specific items of restitution or their dollar amounts. This burden of production must include a detailed sworn affidavit of the offender setting forth all challenges to the restitution or items of restitution, and specifying all reasons justifying dollar amounts of restitution which differ from the amounts requested by the victim or victims. The affidavit must be served on the prosecuting attorney and the court at least five business days before the hearing. A dispute as to the proper amount or type of restitution must be resolved by the court by the preponderance of the evidence. The burden of demonstrating the amount of loss sustained by a victim as a result of the offense and the appropriateness of a particular type of restitution is on the prosecution.\n(b) An offender may challenge restitution, but must do so by requesting a hearing within 30 days of receiving written notification of the amount of restitution requested, or within 30 days of sentencing, whichever is later. The hearing request must be made in writing and filed with the court administrator. A defendant may not challenge restitution after the 30-day time period has passed.",
