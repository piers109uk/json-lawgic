	"text": "(a) The legislature seeks to encourage both the reduction of the amount and type of material entering the solid waste stream and the reuse and recycling of materials. Solid waste represents discarded material and energy resources, and it also represents an economic burden to the people of the state. The recycling of solid waste materials is one alternative for the conservation of material and energy resources, but it is also in the public interest to reduce the amount of materials requiring recycling or disposal.\n(b) The legislature also seeks to encourage the design and implementation of regional programs for materials conservation which take into account the variations in solid waste generation throughout the state.",
