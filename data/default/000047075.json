	"text": "(a) When either or both parents are legally responsible for a nonjoint child, a deduction for this obligation shall be calculated under this section.\n(b) Court-ordered child support for a nonjoint child shall be deducted from the payor's gross income.\n(c) When a parent is legally responsible for a nonjoint child and the parent is not obligated to pay basic child support for the nonjoint child to the other parent or a legal custodian under an existing child support order, a deduction shall be calculated. The court shall use the basic support guideline table under section 518A.35 to determine this deduction by using the gross income of the parent for whom the deduction is being calculated, minus any deduction under paragraph (b) and the number of eligible nonjoint children, up to six children. The deduction for nonjoint children is 75 percent of the guideline amount determined under this paragraph.",
