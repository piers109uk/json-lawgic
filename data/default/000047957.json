	"text": "The registrar of titles may appoint one or more deputy registrars of titles, who may also be deputy county recorders, to act in the registrar's stead. Deputy registrars shall act in the name of the registrar and their acts shall be the registrar's acts. The registrar shall be liable for any neglect or omission of a deputy to the same extent as for the registrar's own neglect or omission. The registrar may, with the consent of the county board, employ such clerks as may be required to properly perform the duties of office. In all counties in which the county recorder does not receive the fees of the office in lieu of a salary, the county board shall fix the compensation of all deputy registrars and clerks appointed or employed by the registrar which shall be paid out of any county funds not otherwise appropriated.",
