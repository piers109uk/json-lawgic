	"text": "The legislature finds that the collapse of the Interstate Highway 35W bridge over the Mississippi River in Minneapolis on August 1, 2007, was a catastrophe of historic proportions. The bridge was the third busiest in the state, carrying over 140,000 cars per day. Its collapse killed 13 people and injured more than 100. No other structure owned by this state has ever fallen with such devastating physical and psychological impact on so many.\nThe establishment of a compensation process under sections 3.7391 to 3.7395 for survivors of the catastrophe furthers the public interest by providing a remedy for survivors while avoiding the uncertainty and expense of potentially complex and protracted litigation to resolve the issue of the liability of the state, a municipality, or their employees for damages incurred by survivors.\nThese findings are not an admission of liability of the state, a municipality, or their employees for damages caused by the catastrophe.",
