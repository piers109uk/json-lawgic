	"text": "A recipient of money appropriated from the trust fund for easement monitoring and enforcement may spend the money only on activities included in an easement monitoring and enforcement plan contained within the work plan. Money received for monitoring and enforcement, including earnings on the money received, must be kept in a monitoring and enforcement fund held by the recipient and dedicated to monitoring and enforcing conservation easements in Minnesota. A recipient of an appropriation for easement monitoring and enforcement must, within 120 days after the close of the recipient's fiscal year, provide an annual financial report to the commission or the commission's successor on the easement monitoring and enforcement fund as specified in the work plan. Money appropriated from the trust fund for monitoring and enforcement of easements and earnings on the money appropriated revert to the state if:\n(1) the easement transfers to the state;\n(2) the recipient fails to file an annual financial report and then fails to cure the default within 30 days of notification of the default by the state; or\n(3) the recipient fails to comply with the terms of the monitoring and enforcement plan contained within the work plan and fails to cure the default within 90 days of notification of the default by the state.",
