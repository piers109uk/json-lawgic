	"text": "Compliance with sections 306.16 to 306.20 reinvests the association or municipality with, and divests the record owner and dependents of, the title to the part of the cemetery lot unused for burial purposes as though the lot had never been conveyed to any person. The association or municipality then owns the reclaimed part of the lot for its own purposes, subject to state law and to the charter, bylaws, rules, and regulations of the association or municipality. The association or municipality may not transfer the title of the lot for one year after the adoption of the resolution provided for in section 306.16. If during the one-year period a person entitled by state law to the cemetery lot pays to the association or public cemetery all the unpaid lot care, the expenses of the service of the notice provided for in section 306.16, and any additional amount due for lot care after the date of the notice under the bylaws, rules, and regulations of the cemetery association or public cemetery, and contracts and pays for the perpetual care of the lot, the association or cemetery shall reconvey the lot to the person lawfully entitled to it.",
