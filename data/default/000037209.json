	"text": "(a) The county auditor may license any person having the qualifications specified in paragraph (b) as an auctioneer. The license shall be issued by the auditor and shall authorize the licensee to conduct the business of an auctioneer in the state of Minnesota for the period of one year. It shall be recorded by the auditor in a book kept for that purpose. The license must specify the county issuing the license and must contain a number that individually identifies the auctioneer holding the license. Before the license is issued the applicant shall pay into the county treasury a fee of $20.\n(b) A natural person is qualified to be licensed as an auctioneer if 18 years of age or over and a resident of the county of application for at least six months immediately preceding the date of application. No copartnership, association or corporation may be licensed as an auctioneer. However, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed as preventing auctioneers who are duly licensed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, from combining in associations, copartnerships, or corporations, provided that each and every member of these associations or copartnerships and each and every person or agent conducting auction sales on behalf of these corporations is a duly licensed auctioneer as provided in this chapter. Nothing herein shall be construed to apply to the owner of property for at least six months selling it at an auction.\nMS 1961 [Repealed, 1965 c 874 s 10]",
