	"text": "The league may establish a policy to guide member high schools in forming or altering interscholastic conferences.\nA league member high school that is not in a conference may ask the league to arrange membership for the league member in an interscholastic conference.\nThe reason the member is not in a conference must be: (1) the conference was dissolved, or (2) the member was involuntarily excluded.\nBefore asking the league to arrange membership, the school must make a good faith attempt over at least 90 days to join a conference. The 90 days run from the date of the school's first written request to join or rejoin a conference.\nThe league must arrange the conference membership within 90 days after receiving a timely written request from a league member high school.\nThe league must follow its criteria in arranging the conference membership.\n(a) The requesting school or a high school already in the conference that is the subject of the proposed arrangement may request a timely public hearing on the proposed arrangement.\n(b) The league must notify the schools mentioned in paragraph (a) of the right to a hearing.\nThe league's final decision on a matter of conference membership under this section is binding on all of the schools required to be notified of the right to a hearing.\nExcept to the extent the league arranges conference membership under this section, an interscholastic conference of schools participating in activities delegated to the league may be formed and changed freely.",
