	"text": "The commissioner of natural resources on determining that it is necessary to acquire any interest in a part of a tract or parcel of real estate for purposes of the Minnesota Valley Trail, may acquire in fee the whole or any additional parts of the tract or parcel that the commissioner deems to be in the best interests of the state.\nWithin one year after acquiring excess real estate pursuant to subdivision 1, the commissioner of natural resources shall notify the governor that the excess real estate is available for sale. The commissioner shall then publish notice of sale for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the territory from which bids are likely to be received. After receipt of sealed bids, and upon recommendation of the commissioner of natural resources, the governor shall convey the excess real estate by quitclaim deed in a form approved by the attorney general in the name of the state to the highest responsible bidder. The deed may contain restrictive clauses limiting the use of the real estate in the interest of preserving the integrity of the trail when the commissioner finds that the restrictions are reasonably necessary.\nThe commissioner may lease for the term between the acquisition and sale thereof and for a fair rental rate and upon terms and conditions that the commissioner deems proper, any excess real estate acquired under the provisions of this section and any real estate acquired in fee for natural resources purposes and not presently needed therefor. All rents received from the leases shall be paid into the state treasury.",
