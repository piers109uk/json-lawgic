	"text": "(a) If eight or more landowners in a home rule charter or statutory city or town petition the governing body for a vote on a partition fence policy, the governing body may adopt its own policy and procedures for dealing with partition fences, including enforcement procedures. When a town board adopts a partition fence policy, the policy must be approved by the electors of the town at an annual or special town meeting, in which case this chapter does not apply in that town.\n(b) This chapter applies to any partition fence lying on the boundary between a political subdivision that has adopted its own partition fence policy and any other political subdivision unless the other political subdivision has adopted a similar policy.",
