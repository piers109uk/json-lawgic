	"text": "When the sole attorney of a party to any action or proceeding in any court of record dies, becomes mentally incapacitated, or is removed or suspended, the party for whom the attorney appears shall appoint another attorney within ten days after the disability arises, and give immediate written notice of the substitution to the adverse party. If the party fails to make substitution within such time, the adverse party, at least 20 days before taking further proceedings against the party, shall give the party written notice to appoint another attorney. When, for any reason, the attorney for a party ceases to act, and the party has no known residence within the state, such notice may be served upon the court administrator. In case such party fails either to comply with the notice or appear in person within 30 days, the party shall not be entitled to notice of subsequent proceedings in the case.",
