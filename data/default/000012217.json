	"text": "(a) The commissioner of agriculture for pollution resulting from agricultural chemicals and practices and the Pollution Control Agency for other pollutants shall evaluate the detection of pollutants in groundwater of the state. Evaluation of the detection may include collection technique, sampling handling technique, laboratory practices, other quality control practices, climatological conditions, and potential pollutant sources.\n(b) If conditions indicate a likelihood of the detection of the pollutant or pollutant breakdown product to be a common detection, the commissioner of agriculture or the Pollution Control Agency must begin development of best management practices and continue to monitor for the pollutant or pollutant breakdown products.\nThe commissioner of agriculture for pollution resulting from agricultural chemicals and practices and the Pollution Control Agency for other pollutants shall develop and implement groundwater monitoring and hydrogeologic evaluation following pollution detection to evaluate pollution frequency and concentration trend. Assessment of the site-specific and pollutant-specific conditions and the likelihood of common detection must include applicable monitoring, pollutant use information, physical and chemical properties of the pollutant, hydrogeologic information, and review of information and data from other local, state, or federal monitoring databases.",
