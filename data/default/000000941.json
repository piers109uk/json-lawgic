	"text": "The commissioner may issue a duplicate of an unpaid warrant to an owner if the owner certifies that the original was lost or destroyed. The commissioner may require certification be documented by affidavit. The commissioner may refuse to issue a duplicate of an unpaid state warrant. If the commissioner acts in good faith, the commissioner is not liable, whether the application is granted or denied.\nWhen the duplicate is issued, the original is void. The commissioner may require an indemnity bond from the applicant to the state for double the amount of the warrant for anyone damaged by the issuance of the duplicate. The commissioner is not liable to any holder who took the void original warrant for value, whether or not the commissioner required an indemnity bond from the applicant.\nFor an unpaid refund or rebate issued under a tax law administered by the commissioner of revenue that has been lost or destroyed, an affidavit is not required for the commissioner to issue a duplicate if the duplicate is issued to the same name and Social Security number as the original warrant and that information is verified on a tax return filed by the recipient.",
