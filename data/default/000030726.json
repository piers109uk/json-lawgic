	"text": "Except as provided in sections 260B.125 and 260B.225, the juvenile court has original and exclusive jurisdiction in proceedings concerning any child who is alleged to be delinquent, a juvenile traffic offender, a juvenile petty offender, and in proceedings concerning any minor alleged to have been a delinquent, a juvenile petty offender, or a juvenile traffic offender prior to having become 18 years of age. The juvenile court shall deal with such a minor as it deals with any other child who is alleged to be delinquent or a juvenile traffic offender.\nNotwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the juvenile court lacks jurisdiction over proceedings concerning a child excluded from the definition of delinquent child under section 260B.007, subdivision 6, paragraph (b). The district court has original and exclusive jurisdiction in criminal proceedings concerning a child excluded from the definition of delinquent child under section 260B.007, subdivision 6, paragraph (b).\nA parent, guardian, or custodian of a child who is subject to the jurisdiction of the court is also subject to the jurisdiction of the court in any matter in which that parent, guardian, or custodian has a right to notice under section 260B.151 or 260B.152, or the right to participate under section 260B.163.",
