	"text": "(a) A person engaged in a development activity that will disturb over one acre of land must submit a sedimentation control plan and time schedule that will prevent excessive soil loss to the local government having jurisdiction over the land before the development activity is to begin.\n(b) A sedimentation control plan and time schedule must specify how the movement of soil and damage to other property during the construction will be minimized, including the use of temporary seeding, fiber mats, plastic, straw, mulch, sediment control basins, and other measures to prevent erosion and sediment damage. The time schedule must establish deadlines for the implementation and completion of each phase or element of the sedimentation control plan.\nThe local government may appoint the zoning and planning director, building inspector, county engineer, or the soil and water conservation district to review the plan and time schedule. If the sedimentation control plan and time schedule will prevent excessive soil loss to the most practicable extent, the local government must issue a permit that authorizes the development activity contingent upon the implementation and completion of the sedimentation control plan.\nA person engaged in a development activity who does not obtain a sedimentation control plan permit or does not commence or complete the plan or make satisfactory progress to complete the plan is subject to a civil penalty. Soil conservation practices made in good faith and substantial compliance are a defense.\nFor counties, the provisions of this section apply only to county jurisdiction over unincorporated areas.",
