	"text": "For the purpose of providing money to be appropriated or loaned to municipalities under the Minnesota state water pollution control program for the acquisition and betterment of public land, buildings, and improvements of a capital nature needed for the prevention, control, and abatement of water pollution in accordance with the provisions of section 116.16, when such appropriations or loans are authorized by law and funds therefor are requested by the agency, the commissioner of management and budget shall sell and issue bonds of the state of Minnesota for the prompt and full payment of which, with interest thereon, the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of the state are irrevocably pledged. Bonds shall be issued pursuant to this section only as authorized by a law specifying the purpose thereof and the maximum amount of the proceeds authorized to be expended for this purpose. Any act authorizing the issuance of bonds for this purpose, together with this section, constitutes complete authority for such issue, and such bonds shall not be subject to restrictions or limitations contained in any other law.\nUpon request by resolution of the agency and upon authorization as provided in subdivision 1 the commissioner of management and budget shall sell and issue Minnesota state water pollution control bonds in the aggregate amount requested, upon sealed bids and upon such notice, at such price, in such form and denominations, bearing interest at a rate or rates, maturing in amounts and on dates, with or without option of prepayment upon notice and at specified times and prices, payable at a bank or banks within or outside the state, with provisions, if any, for registration, conversion, and exchange and for the issuance of temporary bonds or notes in anticipation of the sale or delivery of definitive bonds, and in accordance with further provisions, as the commissioner of management and budget shall determine, subject to the approval of the attorney general, but not subject to chapter 14, including section 14.386. The bonds shall be executed by the commissioner of management and budget under official seal. The signature of the commissioner on the bonds and any appurtenant interest coupons and the seal may be printed, lithographed, engraved, stamped, or otherwise reproduced thereon, except that each bond shall be authenticated by the manual signature on its face of the commissioner or of an authorized representative of a bank designated by the commissioner as registrar or other authenticating agent. The commissioner of management and budget shall ascertain and certify to the purchasers of the bonds the performance and existence of all acts, conditions, and things necessary to make them valid and binding general obligations of the state of Minnesota, subject to the approval of the attorney general.\nAll expenses incidental to the sale, printing, execution, and delivery of bonds pursuant to this section, including but not limited to actual and necessary travel and subsistence expenses of state officers and employees for such purposes, and any expenses of litigation relating to the validity of the bonds, shall be paid from the bond proceeds fund, and the amounts necessary therefor are appropriated from that fund; provided that if any amount is specifically appropriated for this purpose in an act authorizing the issuance of bonds pursuant to this section, such expenses shall be limited to the amount so appropriated.\nThe commissioner of management and budget shall maintain in the state bond fund a separate bookkeeping account which shall be designated as the state water pollution control bond account, to record receipts and disbursements of money transferred to the fund to pay Minnesota state water pollution control bonds and income from the investment of such money, which income shall be credited to the account in each fiscal year in an amount equal to the approximate average return that year on all funds invested by the commissioner of management and budget, as determined by the commissioner of management and budget, times the average balance in the account that year.\nThe premium and accrued interest received on each issue of Minnesota state water pollution control bonds, and all loan payments received under the provisions of section 116.16, subdivision 5, shall be credited to the bond account. All income from the investment of Minnesota state water pollution control bond proceeds, shall also be credited to the bond account. In order to reduce the amount of taxes otherwise required to be levied, there shall also be credited to the bond account therein from the general fund in the state treasury, on November 1 in each year, a sum of money sufficient in amount, when added to the balance then on hand therein, to pay all Minnesota water pollution control bonds and interest thereon due and to become due to and including July 1 in the second ensuing year. All money so credited and all income from the investment thereof is annually appropriated to the bond account for the payment of such bonds and interest thereon, and shall be available in the bond account prior to the levy of the tax in any year required by the constitution, article XI, section 7. The commissioner of management and budget is directed to make the appropriate entries in the accounts of the respective funds.\nOn or before December 1 in each year the state auditor shall levy on all taxable property within the state whatever tax may be necessary to produce an amount sufficient, with all money then and theretofore credited to the bond account, to pay the entire amount of principal and interest then and theretofore due and principal and interest to become due on or before July 1 in the second year thereafter on Minnesota water pollution control bonds. This tax shall be subject to no limitation of rate or amount until all such bonds and interest thereon are fully paid. The proceeds of this tax are appropriated and shall be credited to the state bond fund, and the principal of and interest on the bonds are payable from such proceeds, and the whole thereof, or so much as may be necessary, is appropriated for such payments. If at any time there is insufficient money from the proceeds of such taxes to pay the principal and interest when due on Minnesota water pollution control bonds, such principal and interest shall be paid out of the general fund in the state treasury, and the amount necessary therefor is hereby appropriated.",
