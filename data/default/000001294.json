This signature requirement does not apply to a month in which the person's long-distance phone bill paid by the state is less than $5.\n(b) Even if the monthly long-distance phone bill paid by the state for a person subject to this section is less than $5, the person is responsible for paying that portion of the bill that does not relate to state business.
