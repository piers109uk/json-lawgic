	"text": "Earned incentive release credits are included in calculating the term of imprisonment but are not added to the person's supervised release term, the total length of which remains unchanged. The maximum amount of earned incentive release credit that can be earned and subtracted from the term of imprisonment is 17 percent of the total executed sentence. Earned credit cannot reduce the term of imprisonment to less than one-half of the incarcerated person's executed sentence. Once earned, earned incentive release credits are nonrevocable.",
