	"text": "The order is a conclusive determination that the necessity for the levying of the assessment exists; provided, that the corporation, or any stockholder or creditor thereof, may secure a review of the commissioner's order by serving a notice requesting review upon the commissioner within 20 days after the service of the order upon the aggrieved party. This notice, with proof of service, shall be filed within ten days after service with the court administrator of the district court in the county where the corporation has its principal place of business. The district court then has jurisdiction to consider the necessity of levying the assessment. It shall hear and determine the matter de novo in or out of term at any place in the district. This hearing shall take precedence of all other matters and may be held upon ten days' written notice by either party. The judge shall make such order in the premises as is proper, and may affirm, vacate, or modify the commissioner's order. An appeal may be taken therefrom as in other civil cases. During the pendency of the appeal the commissioner of commerce shall remain in charge of the business, property, and assets of the corporation involved.",
