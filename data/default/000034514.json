	"text": "Upon the application of the attorney general the district court is vested with jurisdiction to restrain, enjoin, and redress violations of sections 309.50 to 309.61. The court may make any necessary order or judgment including, but not limited to, injunctions, restitution, appointment of a receiver for the defendant or the defendant's assets, suspension of the defendant's registration, awards of reasonable attorney fees, and costs of investigation and litigation, and may award to the state civil penalties up to $25,000 for each violation of sections 309.50 to 309.61. In ordering injunctive relief, the attorney general shall not be required to establish irreparable harm but only a violation of statute or that the requested order promotes the public interest. The court may, as appropriate, enter a consent judgment or decree without the finding of illegality.\nThe attorney general may accept an assurance of discontinuance of any method, act, or practice in violation of sections 309.50 to 309.61 from any person alleged to be engaged or to have been engaged in the method, act, or practice. The assurance may, among other terms, include a stipulation for the voluntary payment by the person of the costs of investigation, or of an amount to be held in escrow pending the outcome of an action or as restitution to aggrieved persons, or both. Any assurance of discontinuance shall be in writing and be filed with the district court of the county of the violator's residence or principal place of business or in Ramsey County. An assurance shall not be considered an admission of a violation for any purpose. Failure to comply with the assurance of discontinuance shall be punishable as contempt.",
