	"text": "Every rate service organization and every insurer which makes its own rates shall, within a reasonable time after receiving written request therefor, furnish to any insured affected by a rate made by it, or to the authorized representative of that insured, all pertinent information as to that rate. Every rate service organization and every insurer which makes its own rates shall provide within this state reasonable means whereby any person aggrieved by the application of its rating system may be heard, in person or by an authorized representative, on a written request to review the manner in which that rating system has been applied in connection with the insurance afforded. If the rate service organization or insurer fails to grant or reject any such request within 30 days after it is made, the applicant may proceed in the same manner as if the application had been rejected. Any party affected by the action of a rate service organization or insurer on any such request may, within 30 days after written notice of such action, appeal to the commissioner who, after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the appellant and to the rate service organization or insurer, may affirm or reverse its action.",
