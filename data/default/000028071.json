	"text": "No telephone company shall subsidize flexibly priced or non-price-regulated services from other services. A telephone service is not subsidized if the aggregate revenues for the service equal or exceed the total service long-run incremental costs of providing the service. If the commission determines, after a proceeding under section 237.081, that subsidization exists, it shall order changes in rates to price the subsidized service above total service long-run incremental cost and may invoke any other remedies otherwise available under this chapter.",
