	"text": "In any such city there shall be no community health board as defined in section 145A.02, subdivision 5, library board, park board, public utilities commission, or any other administrative board or commission, except for the administration of a function jointly with another political subdivision. The council shall itself be and perform the duties and exercise the powers of the community health board and shall govern and administer the library, parks, and utilities as fully as other municipal functions for the administration of which no independent boards are authorized by statute for cities generally. The council may, however, create boards or commissions to advise the council with respect to any municipal function or activity or to investigate any subject of interest to the city.\nAny such boards and commissions in existence in any city when Optional Plan B is adopted shall continue to operate in all respects as formerly until the qualification of the first city manager, at which time they shall cease to exist and their powers shall be vested in the city council. Any existing civil service commission shall not be affected by the change. After abandonment of the plan in any such city and the establishment of the standard plan or Optional Plan A, any board or commission authorized by statute in cities generally may be established in the same manner as in other cities.",
