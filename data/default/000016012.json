A joint powers board making a levy must certify to each participating district tax levies sufficient to raise the amount necessary to provide the district's portion of severance pay and early retirement incentives. The tax levy certified to each district must be expressed as a local tax rate, that, when applied to the adjusted net tax capacity of all of the participating districts raises the amount necessary to provide severance pay and early retirement incentives. Each participating school district must include the levy in the next tax roll which it shall certify to the county auditor, and must remit the collections of the levy to the joint powers board.",
