	"text": "(a) The commission shall, by any method the commission finds appropriate, reduce the rates each electric utility subject to rate regulation by the commission charges its customers to reflect, on an ongoing basis, the amount by which each utility's property tax on the personal property of its electric system from taxes payable in 2001 to taxes payable in 2002 is reduced. The commission must ensure that, to the extent feasible, each dollar of personal property tax reduction allocated to Minnesota consumers retroactive to January 1, 2002, results in a dollar of savings to the utility's customers. A utility may voluntarily pass on any additional property tax savings allocated in the same manner as approved by the commission under this paragraph.\n(b) By April 10, 2002, each utility shall submit a filing to the commission containing:\n(1) certified information regarding the utility's property tax savings allocated to Minnesota retail customers; and\n(2) a proposed method of passing these savings on to Minnesota retail customers.\nThe utility shall provide the information in clause (1) to the commissioner of revenue at the same time. The commissioner shall notify the commission within 30 days as to the accuracy of the property tax data submitted by the utility.\n(c) For purposes of this section, \"personal property\" means tools, implements, and machinery of the generating plant. It does not apply to transformers, transmission lines, distribution lines, or any other tools, implements, and machinery that are part of an electric substation, wherever located.",
