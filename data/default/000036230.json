Rights of the buyer or lessee under this section can only be asserted as a matter of defense to or setoff against a claim by the assignee.\n(5) In a sale or lease in violation of this section, the seller or lessor may not take a negotiable instrument other than a check as evidence of the obligation of the buyer or lessee. A holder is not in good faith if the holder takes a negotiable instrument with notice that it is issued in violation of this section.\n(6) Any person who violates any provision of this subdivision shall be guilty of a gross misdemeanor.\nSections 325F.68 to 325F.70 shall apply to actions of the owner, publisher, agent or employee of newspapers, magazines, other printed matter or radio or television stations or other advertising media used for the publication or dissemination of an advertisement, only if the owner, publisher, agent, or employee has either knowledge of the false, misleading or deceptive character of the advertisement or a financial interest in the sale or distribution of the advertised merchandise.\nThe act, use, or employment by any person of any solicitation for payment of money by another by any statement or invoice, or any writing that could reasonably be interpreted as a statement or invoice, for merchandise not yet ordered or for services not yet performed and not yet ordered, whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived, or damaged thereby, is enjoinable as provided in section 325F.70.\nIt is illegal for any person to represent falsely that a sale is a \"going out of business sale.\" Any representation that a sale is a \"going out of business sale\" is presumed to be false and illegal under this subdivision, if at that location or within a relevant market area:\n(1) the sale has been represented to be a \"going out of business sale\" for a period of more than 120 days;\n(2) the business has increased its inventory for the sale by ordering or purchasing an unusual amount of merchandise during the sale or during the 90 days before the sale began;\n(3) the business, or any of its officers or directors, has advertised any other sale as a \"going out of business sale\" during the 120 days before this sale began; or\n(4) the sale has continued after a date on which the business has represented, expressly or by reasonable implication, that the business would terminate.\nAny presumption arising under clauses (1) to (4) may be rebutted if the business shows, by clear and convincing evidence, that the sale was in fact conducted in anticipation of the imminent termination of the business. This subdivision does not apply to a sale in any statutory or home rule charter city that by ordinance requires the licensing of persons conducting a \"going out of business sale,\" nor to public officers acting in the course of their official duties.\nNo person shall include the name, trade name, logo, or tagline of a financial institution as defined in section 49.01, subdivision 2, in a written solicitation for financial services directed to a customer who has obtained a loan from the financial institution without written permission from the financial institution, unless the solicitation clearly and conspicuously states that the person is not sponsored by or affiliated with the financial institution, which shall be identified by name. This statement shall be made in close proximity to, and in the same or larger font size as, the first and most prominent use or uses of the name, trade name, logo, or tagline in the solicitation, including on an envelope or through an envelope window containing the solicitation. For purposes of this section, the term \"financial institution\" includes a financial institution's affiliates and subsidiaries. This subdivision shall not prohibit the use of a financial institution name, trade name, logo, or tagline of a financial institution if the use of that name is part of a fair and accurate comparison of like products or services.\n(a) For purposes of this subdivision, \"conversion therapy\" means services or products that are intended to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity, including efforts to change behaviors and gender expressions or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same gender.\n(b) No person or entity shall, while conducting any trade or commerce, use or employ any fraud, false pretense, false promise, false guarantee, misrepresentation, false or misleading statements, or deceptive practice by advertising or otherwise offering conversion therapy services that could reasonably be interpreted or inferred as representing homosexuality as a mental disease, disorder, or illness, or guaranteeing to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.\nFor purposes of this section, an unfair method of competition or an unfair or unconscionable act or practice is any method of competition, act, or practice that: (1) offends public policy as established by the statutes, rules, or common law of Minnesota; (2) is unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; or (3) is substantially injurious to consumers.",
