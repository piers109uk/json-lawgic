That order to show cause shall be served upon the licensee in the manner prescribed by law for the service of summons in a civil action, or by certified mail, not less than eight days before the date fixed for the hearing thereof. A copy of the order shall forthwith be mailed to the owner of the premises, as shown by the records in the office of the county recorder, at the owner's last known post office address. A copy of the order shall at the same time be mailed to any other issuing authority, of which the authority issuing the order to show cause has knowledge, by which other license to that licensee may have been issued, and any such other authority may participate in the suspension or revocation proceedings after notifying the licensee and the officer or authority holding the hearing of its intention so to do on or before the date of hearing, and after the hearing take such action as it could have taken had it instituted the suspension or revocation proceedings in the first instance.",
