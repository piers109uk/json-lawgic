	"text": "(a) By December 1 of each year the commissioner must estimate the statewide average adjusted general revenue per adjusted pupil unit and the disparity in adjusted general revenue among pupils and districts by computing the ratio of the 95th percentile to the fifth percentile of adjusted general revenue. The commissioner must provide that information to all districts.\n(b) If the disparity in adjusted general revenue as measured by the ratio of the 95th percentile to the fifth percentile increases in any year, the commissioner shall recommend to the legislature options for change in the general education formula that will limit the disparity in adjusted general revenue to no more than the disparity for the previous school year. The commissioner must submit the recommended options to the education committees of the legislature by February 1.\n(c) For purposes of this section and section 126C.10, adjusted general revenue means the sum of basic revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 2; referendum revenue under section 126C.17; local optional revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 2e; and equity revenue under section 126C.10, subdivision 24.",
