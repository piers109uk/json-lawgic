	"text": "The authority may create and establish one or more special funds, each to be known as a \"bond reserve fund\" and shall pay into each bond reserve fund any money appropriated and made available by the state for the purpose of the fund, any proceeds of sale of bonds to the extent provided in the resolutions of the authority authorizing their issuance, and any other money that is available to the authority for the purpose of the fund from any other sources. Money held in a bond reserve fund, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, must be used as required solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured in whole or in part by the fund or of the sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds, the purchase or redemption of the bonds, the payment of interest on the bonds, or the payments of any redemption premium required to be paid when the bonds are redeemed prior to maturity.\nMoney in a bond reserve fund may not be withdrawn from it in an amount that will reduce the amount of the fund to less than the bond reserve fund requirement established for the fund, as provided in this section, except for the purpose of making payment when due of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and the sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds for the payment of which other money of the authority is not available. Any income or interest earned by, or incremental to, a bond reserve fund due to the investment of it may be transferred by the authority to other funds or accounts of the authority to the extent the transfer does not reduce the amount of that bond reserve fund below the bond reserve fund requirement for it.\nThe authority may not at any time issue bonds, secured in whole or in part by a bond reserve fund if, upon the issuance of the bonds, the amount in the bond reserve fund will be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for the fund, unless the authority at the time of issuance of the bonds deposits in the fund from the proceeds of the bonds issued or from other sources an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund will not be less than the bond reserve fund requirement for the fund. For the purposes of this section, the term \"bond reserve fund requirement\" means, as of any particular date of computation, an amount of money required to be on deposit therein in the bond reserve fund, as provided in the resolutions of the authority authorizing the bonds with respect to which the fund is established.\nAmounts paid over to the authority by the state under this section constitute and must be accounted for as advances by the state to the authority and, subject to the rights of the holders of any bonds of the authority, must be repaid to the state without interest from all available operating revenues of the authority in excess of amounts required for the payment of bonds, the bond reserve fund, and operating expenses.\nThe authority shall cause to be delivered to the finance committees in the legislature within 90 days of the close of its fiscal year its annual report certified by an independent certified public accountant, who may be the accountant or a member of the firm of accountants who regularly audits the books and accounts of the authority selected by the authority. In the event that the principal amount of any bonds deposited in a bond reserve fund is withdrawn for payment of principal or interest thereby reducing the amount of that fund to less than the bond reserve fund requirement, the authority shall immediately notify the legislature of this event and take steps to restore the fund to its bond reserve fund requirement from any amounts available, other than principal of a bond issue, that are not pledged to the payment of other bonds.",
