Disbursements shall be taxed upon ten days' written notice to adverse parties.\nWhere (1) an award of compensation is affirmed, or modified and affirmed, (2) an order disallowing compensation is reversed, or (3) a petition to vacate an award is granted, the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals may include in its award an amount to cover a reasonable attorney fee or may allow an attorney fee in a proceeding to tax disbursements.\nIf the employer or insurer files a notice of discontinuance of an employee's benefits and an administrative conference is held to resolve the dispute, but the employer or insurer fails to attend the administrative conference, the commissioner or compensation judge may order the employer or insurer to pay the employee's attorney fees as a cost under this section if the employee's benefits are continued.\nOn review by the supreme court upon certiorari, costs and disbursements shall be taxed as they are upon appeals in civil actions.\nWhere upon a review by the supreme court upon certiorari, an award of compensation is affirmed, or modified and affirmed, or an order disallowing compensation is reversed, the court may allow a reasonable attorney fee incident to the review.
