	"text": "The commissioner shall, by order, assign an identification number to each district. The assignment shall be made so that each classified district has an exclusive identification number.\nUpon making the assignment of an identification number, the commissioner shall notify the clerk of the district and the county auditors of the counties in which any part of the district lies of the identification number assigned. A certified copy of the order may be recorded in the office of the county recorder to show the new legal name of the district.\nThe legal identification of the district shall become the assigned identification number. All records, correspondence, reports and references to the district must thereafter refer to the district by its proper title as assigned.\nA number assigned to a district under section 123A.55 or under any prior law, must not be used again to identify any district in the same classification. As the need arises, and as required by law, as new districts are formed, the commissioner shall assign unused numbers as identification. When numbered districts are dissolved, the numbers assigned to them will not be reassigned to any other district.",
