	"text": "Any person whose property is proposed to be taken or interfered with or assessed under any provisions of sections 465.26 to 465.48, or who claims to be damaged by the improvement, and who deems that there is any irregularity in the proceedings of the city council, or action of the appraisers, by reason of which the award of the appraisers ought not to be confirmed, or who is dissatisfied with the amount of damages awarded for the taking of, or interference with the person's property, or the assessment thereon, may, at any time before the time specified for the consideration of the award and assessment by the city council, file with the city clerk in writing objections to such confirmation, setting forth therein specifically the particular irregularities complained of, and the particular objection to the award or assessment, and containing a description of the property, affected by such proceedings and the person's interest therein, and if, notwithstanding such objections, the city council shall confirm the award or assessment, such persons so objecting shall have the right to appeal from such order of confirmation of the city council to the district court of the county in which the city is situate within 20 days after such order. Such appeal shall be made by serving a written notice of appeal upon the city clerk, which shall specify the property of the appellant affected by such award or improvement, and refer to the objection filed, as aforesaid, thereupon the city clerk, at the expense of the appellant, shall make out and transmit to the court administrator of the district court a copy of the record of the entire proceedings and of the award of the appraisers as confirmed by the city council, and of the order of the city council confirming the same, and of the objections filed by the appellant, as aforesaid, and of the notice of appeal, all certified by the city clerk to be true copies, within ten days after the taking of such appeal. If more than one appeal be taken in the same proceeding, it shall not be necessary that the city clerk in appeals subsequent to the first shall send up anything but a certified copy of the appellant's objections. There shall be no pleading on any appeal, but the court shall determine in the first instance whether there was in the proceedings any such irregularity or omission of duty prejudicial to the appellant and specified in the written objection that as to that appellant the award or assessment of the appraisers ought not to stand, and whether the appraisers had jurisdiction to take action in the premises.",
