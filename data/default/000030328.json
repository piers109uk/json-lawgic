If the relative is unable or unwilling to provide for the ongoing care, custody, and control of the child, the child may be considered a child in need of protection or services under section 260C.007. The relative may report the death or emergency to the local social service agency. Upon receiving the report, the local social service agency shall assess the circumstances and the needs of the child. The agency may place the child in foster care with a relative who meets the licensing standards under chapters 245A and 245C, and may pursue court action on behalf of the child.",
