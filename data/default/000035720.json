The partnership is terminated when the winding up of its business is completed.\n(b) At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up of its business is completed, all of the partners, including any dissociating partner other than a wrongfully dissociating partner, may waive the right to have the partnership's business wound up and the partnership terminated. In that event:\n(1) the partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred; and\n(2) the rights of a third party accruing under section 323A.0804(1), or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver may not be adversely affected.",
