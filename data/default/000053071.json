If the person asks, the peace officer making the arrest shall take the arrested person before a judge of the county in which the arrest is made, for a recognizance without trial or hearing. The judge may take from the arrested person a recognizance with sufficient sureties for that person's appearance before the court having jurisdiction of the offense in the county. After the recognizance is taken, the judge shall release the arrested person. The judge taking bail shall certify the release of the arrested person on bail upon the warrant and deliver it, with the recognizance, to the person making the arrest. The person making the arrest shall deliver it without unnecessary delay to the court administrator before which the accused was recognized to appear. On application of the complainant, the judge who issued the warrant or the county attorney shall summon any witnesses the judge or county attorney considers necessary.",
