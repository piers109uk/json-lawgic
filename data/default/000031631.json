	"title": "276.11 WHEN TREASURER SHALL PAY FUNDS FROM MAY SETTLEMENT.",
	"text": "As soon as practical after the settlement day determined in section 276.09, the county treasurer shall pay to the treasurer of a town, city, school district, or special district, on the warrant of the county auditor, all receipts of taxes levied by the taxing district and deliver up all orders and other evidences of indebtedness of the taxing district, taking triplicate receipts for them. The treasurer shall file one of the receipts with the county auditor, and shall return one by mail on the day of its receipt to the clerk of the town, city, school district, or special district to which payment was made. The clerk shall keep the receipt in the clerk's office. Upon written request of the taxing district, to the extent practicable, the county treasurer shall make partial payments of amounts collected periodically in advance of the next settlement and distribution. A statement prepared by the county treasurer must accompany each payment. It must state the years for which taxes included in the payment were collected and, for each year, the amount of the taxes and any penalties on the tax. Upon written request of a taxing district, except school districts, the county treasurer shall pay at least 70 percent of the estimated collection within 30 days after the settlement date determined in section 276.09. Within seven business days after the due date, or 28 calendar days after the postmark date on the envelopes containing real or personal property tax statements, whichever is latest, the county treasurer shall pay to the treasurer of the school districts 50 percent of the estimated collections arising from taxes levied by and belonging to the school district, unless the school district elects to receive 50 percent of the estimated collections arising from taxes levied by and belonging to the school district after making a proportionate reduction to reflect any loss in collections as the result of any delay in mailing tax statements. In that case, 50 percent of those adjusted, estimated collections shall be paid by the county treasurer to the treasurer of the school district within seven business days of the due date. The remaining 50 percent of the estimated collections must be paid to the treasurer of the school district within the next seven business days of the later of the dates in the preceding sentence, unless the school district elects to receive the remainder of its estimated collections after a proportionate reduction has been made to reflect any loss in collections as the result of any delay in mailing tax statements. In that case, the remaining 50 percent of those adjusted, estimated collections shall be paid by the county treasurer to the treasurer of the school district within 14 days of the due date. The treasurer shall pay the balance of the amounts collected to a municipal corporation or other body within 60 days after the settlement date determined in section 276.09. After 45 days interest at an annual rate of eight percent accrues and must be paid to the taxing district. Interest must be paid upon appropriation from the general revenue fund of the county. If not paid, it may be recovered by the taxing district, in a civil action.\nFor purposes of this section and section 276.111, \"estimated collections\" includes estimated collections of taxes and special assessments, and penalties and interest due to the taxing district.\nThe treasurer or other appropriate fiscal officer of a town, city, school district, or special district may appeal to the county board the determination of the amount of estimated collections by the county treasurer under this section or section 276.111. If the county board finds that the amount of estimated collections has been determined by the county treasurer incorrectly, resulting in underpayment to the local taxing districts, it shall order the county treasurer to pay the additional amount necessary to comprise the correct estimated collection amount.",
