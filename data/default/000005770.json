The consolidated or surviving corporation shall become, without further act or deed, the successor of the consolidating or constituent corporations in any and all fiduciary capacities, in which each consolidated or constituent corporation may be acting at the time of the consolidation or merger, and shall be liable to all beneficiaries as fully as if the consolidating or merging corporations had continued its separate corporate existence. If any consolidating or merging corporation shall be nominated and appointed, or shall have been nominated or appointed, as executor, guardian, administrator, agent, or trustee, or in any other trust relationship of fiduciary capacities in any will, trust agreement, trust conveyance, or any other conveyance, order, or judgment of any court, or any other instrument prior to the consolidation or merger, even though the will or other instrument shall not be operative or effective until after the consolidation or merger shall have become effective, every such office, trust relationship, fiduciary capacity, and all of the rights, powers, privileges, duties, discretions, and responsibilities so provided to devolve upon, vest in, or inure to the corporation so nominated or appointed, shall fully and in every respect devolve upon, vest in, and inure to, and be exercised by, the consolidated or surviving corporation, whether there be one or more successive mergers or consolidations.",
