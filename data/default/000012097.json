The actual cost must be paid by the watershed district.\nIf the owner of the bridge or grade refuses to provide for the passage of the equipment, the managers may remove the bridge or grade at the expense of the watershed district, interrupting traffic in the least degree consistent with good work and without delay or unnecessary damage.\nIf the managers are prevented from moving the equipment, the owner of the bridge or grade is liable for the damages resulting from the delay.",
