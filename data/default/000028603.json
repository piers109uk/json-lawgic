	"text": "The executive board shall maintain a regionally based, state-administered system of substance use disorder programs. Counties may refer individuals who are eligible for services under chapter 254B to the substance use disorder units in the regional treatment centers.\nA 15 percent county share of the per diem cost of treatment is required for individuals served within the treatment capacity funded by direct legislative appropriation.\nThe executive board shall establish criteria for admission to the substance use disorder units to maximize federal and private funding sources, fully utilize the regional treatment center capacity, and make state-funded treatment capacity available to counties on an equitable basis. The admission criteria may be adopted without rulemaking. Existing rules governing placements under chapters 254A and 254B do not apply to admissions to the capacity funded by direct appropriation.\nPrivate and third-party collections and payments are appropriated to the executive board for the operation of the substance use disorder units.\nIn addition to the substance use disorder treatment capacity funded by direct legislative appropriation, the regional treatment centers may also provide treatment to:\n(1) individuals whose treatment is paid for out of the behavioral health fund under chapter 254B, in which case placement rules adopted under chapter 254B apply;\n(2) individuals who are ineligible under the behavioral health fund but who are committed for treatment under chapter 253B as provided in section 254B.05, subdivision 4; and\n(3) individuals who are covered through other nonstate payment sources.",
