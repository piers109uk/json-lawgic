	"text": "When a labor dispute arises which is not settled by mediation such dispute may, by written agreement of the parties, be submitted to arbitration on such terms as the parties may specify, including among other methods the arbitration procedure under the terms of sections 572B.01 to 572B.31 and arbitration under the Voluntary Industrial Arbitration Tribunal of the American Arbitration Association. If such agreement so provides, the commissioner of mediation services may act as a member of any arbitration tribunal created by any such agreement and, if the agreement so provides, the commissioner may appoint one or more of such arbitrators. Either or both of the parties to any such agreement or any arbitration tribunal created under any such agreement may apply to the commissioner to have the tribunal designated as a temporary arbitration tribunal and, if so designated, the temporary arbitration tribunal shall have power to administer oaths to witnesses and to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of evidence, which subpoenas shall be enforced in the same manner as subpoenas issued by the commission under section 179.08. Any such temporary arbitration tribunal shall file with the commissioner a copy of its report, duly certified by its chair.",
