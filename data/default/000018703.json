For the purpose of any proceeding, the good faith of any person reporting or testifying under this provision shall be presumed.\n(b) If a person that is or has been involved in, participated in, aided and abetted, conspired, or colluded in the financial misconduct reports the financial misconduct, the department may consider that person's report and assistance in investigating the misconduct as a mitigating factor in the department's pursuit of civil, criminal, or administrative remedies.\n(c) After an investigation is complete, the reporter's name must be kept confidential.
