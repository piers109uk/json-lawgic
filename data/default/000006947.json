	"text": "Invested assets may be counted toward satisfaction of the minimum asset requirement only so far as they are invested in compliance with sections 60L.01 to 60L.15 and orders issued by the commissioner. Assets other than invested assets may be counted toward satisfaction of the minimum asset requirement at admitted annual statement value.\nAn investment which is held as an admitted asset by an insurer on the date on which sections 60L.01 to 60L.15 begin to govern the insurer and which qualified as an admitted asset immediately before this date remain qualified as an admitted asset under sections 60L.01 to 60L.15.\nAssets acquired in the bona fide enforcement of creditors' rights or in bona fide workouts or settlements of disputed claims may be counted for the purposes of subdivision 1 for five years after acquisition if real property and three years if not real property, even if they could not otherwise be counted under sections 60L.01 to 60L.15. The commissioner may allow reasonable extensions of these periods if replacement of the assets within the periods would not be possible without substantial loss.\nIf an insurer does not own, or is unable to apply toward compliance with sections 60L.01 to 60L.15, an amount of assets equal to its minimum asset requirement, the commissioner may consider it to be financially hazardous under section 60B.15; 60B.20; or 60G.20.",
