	"text": "The commissioner may, with the approval by resolution of the Executive Council, issue state bonds in accordance with section 16A.641 to refund any outstanding state bonds and interest on them. The proceeds of refunding bonds shall be credited to the account established within the state bond fund for the bonds to be refunded, and shall be credited only against the appropriations in section 16A.641, subdivisions 9 and 10 and the tax required by the constitution with respect to the refunded bonds and interest.\nRefunding bonds may be sold publicly, or directly to the State Board of Investment without bids, or may be exchanged for bonds refunded by agreement with their holders. The refunding bonds must be prepared, executed, delivered, and secured in the same way as the refunded bonds. The proceeds of refunding bonds may be deposited, invested, and applied to accomplish the refunding as provided in section 475.67, subdivisions 5 to 10 and 13. Bids for the securities to be purchased for the escrow account may be secured, at the commissioner's election, either through the State Board of Investment or a suitable financial institution. The interest rate on refunding bonds may exceed that on the refunded bonds if the purpose of refunding is to extend the maturities and to reduce the amount needed annually to pay and to secure the debt.\nThe money needed to carry out this section is appropriated annually.",
