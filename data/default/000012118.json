	"text": "If a single contract exceeds $50,000, and the contract, exclusive of materials furnished and not installed, is one-half or more complete and the contractor is not in default, the contractor may file a verified petition with the auditor stating these facts and requesting that an order be made to pay 40 percent of the retained value of work and material.\nWhen the petition is filed, the auditor shall set a time and location for a hearing on the petition before the drainage authority. At least five days before the date of hearing, the auditor shall give notice by mail of the date and location of hearing to the engineer, the attorney for the petitioners, the surety of the contractor's bond, and auditors of the affected counties.\nAt the hearing the drainage authority shall hear all parties interested. If the drainage authority determines that the facts in the petition are correct, the work has been performed in a satisfactory manner, and a portion of the retained percentage may be released without endangering the interests of affected counties, the drainage authority shall state the findings and may order not more than 40 percent of the retained value of work and material to be paid.",
