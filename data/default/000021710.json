The solicitation of proposals may be canceled at any time at the commissioner's sole discretion if cancellation is considered to be in the state's best interest. If the commissioner rejects all responses or cancels the solicitation for proposals, the commissioner may resolicit a request for proposals using the same or different requirements.\nThe commissioner shall notify the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over transportation policy and transportation finance each time the commissioner decides to use the construction manager/general contractor method of procurement and explain why that method was chosen.",
