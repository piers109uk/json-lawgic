	"text": "It is hereby declared to be the public policy of this state that scientific evidence shows that addiction to alcohol or other drugs is a chronic brain disorder with potential for recurrence, and as with many other chronic conditions, people with substance use disorders can be effectively treated and can enter recovery. The interests of society are best served by reducing the stigma of substance use disorder and providing persons who are dependent upon alcohol or other drugs with a comprehensive range of rehabilitative and social services that span intensity levels and are not restricted to a particular point in time. Further, it is declared that treatment under these services shall be voluntary when possible: treatment shall not be denied on the basis of prior treatment; treatment shall be based on an individual treatment plan for each person undergoing treatment; treatment shall include a continuum of services available for a person leaving a program of treatment; treatment shall include all family members at the earliest possible phase of the treatment process.",
