	"text": "All assessments upon real property for local improvements made or levied by the proper authorities of any city in the state shall be a paramount lien upon the land upon which they are imposed from the date of the warrant issued for the collection thereof, or from such other date as by the charter of any such city such assessments become a lien upon the land, and of equal rank with the lien of the state for taxes which have been or may be levied upon the property under the general laws of the state; and the general rules of law as to priority of tax liens shall apply equally to the liens of such assessments and to such liens for general taxes with the same force and effect as though all of these liens and all of these taxes and assessments were of the same general character and imposed for the same purpose and by the same authority, without regard to the priority in point of time of the attaching of either of these liens, and a sale or perfecting title under either shall not bar or extinguish the other. This section shall be applicable to any city existing under a charter framed and adopted prior to November 18, 1958.",
