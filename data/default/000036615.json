The secured party does not owe the park owner any lot rent or other charges which accrued prior to the time the secured party accepted voluntary repossession or took action pursuant to sections 327.61 to 327.67, if:\n(1) within seven days after accepting voluntary repossession or taking action pursuant to sections 327.61 to 327.67, the secured party notifies the park owner in writing that the home is being repossessed;\n(2) during a proceeding for repossession pursuant to sections 327.61 to 327.67 or chapter 565, the secured party pays each month's lot rent as the rent becomes due; and\n(3) within seven days of accepting voluntary repossession or obtaining a court order for repossession, the secured party removes the home from the park.\nIf the secured party fails to meet any of these conditions, the secured party shall also be liable to the park owner for all overdue rent, not to exceed three months and not including late fees or other charges, owed to the park owner on account of the home.\nThis section does not affect any liability or obligation which a secured party may have to a park owner who pursuant to a writ of recovery has removed a home from a lot and stored the home.",
