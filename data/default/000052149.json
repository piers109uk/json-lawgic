	"text": "The panel may set a prehearing settlement conference date. At this conference, the parties must make a good faith attempt to reach a settlement in the case. If the parties agree, they may present the panel with a joint motion for summary disposition and no further hearings are required. If a settlement document is approved by the panel, it has the same effect as an award under section 611.365, for all purposes of that section.\n(a) If the parties are unable to reach a settlement, the panel must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the amount of damages to be awarded to the claimant. The panel may consider any evidence and argument submitted by the parties, including affidavits, documentation, and oral and written arguments. The panel is bound by any fact or damage amount established by the stipulation of the parties.\n(b) Hearings and records relating to the hearing are open to the public, except where, in the interest of justice, the panel orders a hearing closed or a record sealed.",
