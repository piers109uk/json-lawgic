	"text": "All licensed wholesalers must own or lease warehouse space within the state and must have adequate delivery facilities to perform the function of a wholesaler.\nExcept as provided in this chapter alcoholic beverages manufactured outside the state may be shipped into the state only to licensed wholesalers and must be unloaded into the wholesaler's warehouse located in the state. Licensed wholesalers may distribute alcoholic beverages only from the warehouse.\nThe provisions of this section relating to warehousing do not apply to a wholesaler of malt liquor located in an adjoining state which permits wholesalers licensed in Minnesota to deliver malt liquor to retailers without warehousing in that state.\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this section, a manufacturer or United States importer of intoxicating liquor manufactured outside Minnesota may authorize, on a form the commissioner prescribes, a Minnesota-licensed manufacturer or wholesaler to purchase intoxicating liquor for direct shipment to another state, or may appoint a Minnesota-licensed manufacturer or wholesaler as its agent to sell or deliver intoxicating liquor to purchasers in other states from the Minnesota warehouse inventory of the Minnesota manufacturer or wholesaler.",
