Access is limited to records created, collected, or maintained by any local social services agency that provided services to a child or a child's family during the five years immediately preceding any out-of-home placement of the child and continuing throughout the period of the placement until the child was returned to the custody of a parent, adopted, or otherwise was no longer the subject of a case plan developed by a county social service agency. A county social service agency shall provide the not public data described in this section to the foster care review team or the foster care policy redesign commissioner upon request.\nNot public data received by the foster care review team or the Foster Care Policy Redesign Commission maintains the same classification in the possession of the team or commission as it had in the possession of the entity providing the data.
