	"text": "In any election, upon demand made of the custodian of the ballots and upon notice to the candidate's opponent, a candidate may keep a continuous visual guard over the ballots until the expiration of the time for instituting contests. In case of a contest, the contestant or contestee may keep a visual guard over the ballots. The guard may be maintained either by the candidate, contestant, or contestee, or by their duly authorized agents, not exceeding two at a time for each party to the contest. If a candidate, contestant, or contestee seeks to guard the ballots, the custodian of the ballots shall appoint some suitable person to guard the ballots so they are not in the sole custody of the candidate, contestant, contestee, or their agents.",
