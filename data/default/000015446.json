	"text": "Sections 124D.12 to 124D.127 authorize districts to evaluate, plan and employ the use of flexible learning year programs. It is anticipated that the open selection of the type of flexible learning year operation from a variety of alternatives will allow each district seeking to utilize this concept to suitably fulfill the educational needs of its pupils. These alternatives must include, but not be limited to, various 45-15 plans, four-quarter plans, quinmester plans, extended learning year plans, and flexible all-year plans. The commissioner must establish clear criteria for evaluating a district's application to use a four-day school week plan, at least annually accept district applications to use a four-day school week plan, and determine whether each application meets the criteria. The commissioner must give a school district one school year's notice before revoking approval of its flexible learning year program. Approval of a four-day school week plan may not be revoked for six years from the date it is granted.",
