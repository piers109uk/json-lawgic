	"text": "A garnishee shall be paid a $15 fee by the creditor at the time of service of a garnishment summons. Failure to pay the fee renders the garnishment void, and the garnishee shall take no action. If a garnishee is required to appear and submit to oral examination, the garnishee shall be tendered, in advance of the examination, fees and mileage for attendance at the rate allowed by law to a witness. These fees may be recovered by the creditor as an allowable disbursement. In extraordinary cases, the garnishee may be allowed additional sums the court considers reasonable for attorneys fees and other necessary expenses. The court shall then determine which party bears the burden of this expense. If specific articles of personal property are garnished, the garnishee is not required to deliver the property to any person until payment of the garnishee's reasonable charges for storage.",
