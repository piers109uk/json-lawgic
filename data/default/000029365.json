	"text": "An applicant or recipient who is otherwise eligible for supplemental aid and who is potentially eligible for maintenance benefits from any other source shall (1) apply for those benefits within 30 days of the county's determination of potential eligibility for those benefits; and (2) execute an interim assistance authorization agreement on a form as directed by the commissioner.\nIf a recipient is eligible for benefits from other sources, and receives a payment from another source for a period during which supplemental aid was also issued, the recipient shall reimburse the county agency for the interim assistance paid. Reimbursement shall not exceed the amount of supplemental aid paid during the time period to which the other maintenance benefits apply. Reimbursement shall not exceed the state standard that applies to that time period. Reimbursement may be sought directly from the other source of maintenance income but remains the primary obligation of the recipient when an interim assistance agreement has been executed.\n[Repealed, 1Sp2005 c 4 art 3 s 20]",
