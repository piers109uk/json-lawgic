Through its officers, it may transact parish business, including calling a rector and determining the rector's salary. In its corporate name, it may acquire or receive, by purchase, gift, grant, devise, or bequest, any property, real, personal, or mixed, and hold, sell, transfer, mortgage, convey, loan, let, or otherwise use the property for the use and benefit of the parish if the use does not contravene the laws and usages of the Protestant Episcopal church of the state.
