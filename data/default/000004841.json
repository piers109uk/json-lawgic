	"text": "The board shall prepare standard forms and supply the forms for distribution to those who desire to apply for a brand. The application must show a left and right side view of the animals upon which a mark or brand will be eligible for registry. The mark or brand location must be designated to the following body regions: head, bregma, right and left jaw, neck, shoulder, rib, hip, and breech. The applicant must select at least three distinct marks or brands listed in preferred order, and three locations on the animal listed in preferred order. The application must be properly signed and notarized and accompanied by a fee of $10. The mark or brand, if approved and accepted by the board, is valid during the ten-year period in which it is recorded. A person who knowingly places on an animal a mark or brand which has not been registered with the board and which is in duplication of a mark or brand that is registered with the board is guilty of a felony. \"Duplication\" means the use of a similar mark or brand, used in any position on the animal designated for the use of a registered mark or brand, such as the head, bregma, jaw, neck, shoulder, rib, hip, or breech. A person who alters or defaces a brand or mark on any animal to prevent its identification by its owner is guilty of a felony.",
