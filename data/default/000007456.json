	"text": "The legislature finds that the staggering growth in health care costs is having a devastating effect on the health and cost of living of Minnesota residents. The legislature further finds that the number of uninsured and underinsured residents is growing each year and that the cost of health care coverage for our insured residents is increasing annually at a rate that far exceeds the state's overall rate of inflation.\nThe legislature further finds that it must enact immediate and intensive cost containment measures to limit the growth of health care expenditures, reform insurance practices, and finance a plan that offers access to affordable health care for our permanent residents by capturing dollars now lost to inefficiencies in Minnesota's health care system.\nThe legislature further finds that controlling costs is essential to the maintenance of the many factors contributing to the quality of life in Minnesota: our environment, education system, safe communities, affordable housing, provision of food, economic vitality, purchasing power, and stable population.\nIt is, therefore, the intent of the legislature to lay a new foundation for the delivery and financing of health care in Minnesota and to call this new foundation the MinnesotaCare Act.",
