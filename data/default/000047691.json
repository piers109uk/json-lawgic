	"text": "If, in the opinion of the examiner, the applicant has a title to the land proper for registration, or if the applicant, after an adverse opinion of the examiner, elects to proceed further, the applicant shall file with the court administrator a verified petition praying that a summons may be issued in the proceeding. The court shall thereupon examine all the files and records of the proceeding and, by its order, direct that a summons be issued therein. This order shall contain the name and address, so far as known, of every person who is to be joined as a party to the proceeding, including all persons named in the application, or found by the report of the examiner to be in possession of the land, or as having any right, title, interest, or estate therein, or any lien or encumbrance upon or against the same, together with the name and address of all other persons or parties whom the court, in its order, may direct to be joined therein. The parties thus named in the order of the court shall be, and shall be known as, defendants.\nWhen the description in the application includes land which, according to the plat of the United States Government Survey, forms part or all of the bed of a meandered stream or lake, the state of Minnesota shall be made a party defendant. In all cases where decree of registration has been heretofore entered for any such land without the state having been joined and served with summons, it shall be deemed that title had heretofore passed to the applicant by reliction or accretion.",
