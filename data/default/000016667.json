	"text": "(a) Notwithstanding other law or rule to the contrary and in order to effectively meet students' educational needs and foster parents' meaningful participation in their children's education, a school district may apply to the commissioner for a waiver from the requirement to maintain racial balance within a district school if the racial imbalance in that school results from:\n(1) the enrollment of protected multiracial students and the proportion of enrolled multiracial students reflects the proportion of multiracial students who reside in the school attendance area or who are enrolled in the grade levels served by the district; or\n(2) the enrollment of English learners in a transition program that includes an intensive English component.\nThe commissioner must grant the waiver if the district in which the school is located offers the multiracial students or the English learners, as appropriate, the option of enrolling in another school with the requisite racial balance, and the students' parents choose not to pursue that option.\n(b) This section is effective for the 2006-2007 through 2010-2011 school years or until amended rules are adopted under Minnesota Rules, chapter 3535, pertaining to racial diversity, whichever comes first.",
