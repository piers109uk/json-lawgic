	"text": "Policies of life insurance may be delivered or issued for delivery in this state which limit the amount to be paid in the event of death occurring as a result of travel or flight in, or descent from or with, any kind of aircraft if the insured (1) is a pilot, officer or member of the crew of such aircraft, or is participating in aeronautic or aviation training during such flight, or (2) is in the military, naval or air forces of any country and is being transported in a military, naval or air force aircraft. Such amount shall not be less than the reserve on the policy plus any dividends standing to the credit of the policy and the reserve for any paid-up additions, less any indebtedness to the company on the policy. Such limitation may be made by a provision in the policy or by a rider made a part thereof provided, that no such limitation shall be effective unless and until the insured or applicant shall agree in writing thereto; and provided, further, that except in case of policies issued on the lives of persons who have received aeronautic or aviation training or whose occupation entails duty aboard aircraft in flight, such limitation shall apply only in event death occurs within five years after date of issue of the policy. This section shall not affect the validity of provisions which limit the amount to be paid in the event of death of the insured while in the military, naval or air forces of any country at war, or of provisions relative to benefits in the event of total and permanent disability, or of provisions which grant additional insurance specifically against death by accident. Policies issued by life insurance companies organized under the laws of this state for delivery in any other state, territory, district, or country may contain any provisions limiting the amount to be paid in the event of death which are permitted by the laws of such other state, territory, district, or country.",
