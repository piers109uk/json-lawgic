	"text": "The month of July is designated \"Hire a Veteran Month\" in honor of the more than 48,000,000 citizen soldiers who as of January 1, 2005, have served in the United States armed forces, of whom over 1,500,000 have been wounded and over 1,000,000 more have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their lives for their country. Whenever called upon to defend our national security at home or abroad, these men and women serving in the United States Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, and Coast Guard have always responded immediately and effectively, placing the national interests above their own. Each year, the governor shall issue a proclamation honoring this observance, urging Minnesota state and local government departments, agencies, and boards, as well as private employers, to give fair and appropriate consideration to hiring military veterans.",
