Also, this section does not apply to any business combination of the corporation with, with respect to, proposed by or on behalf of, or pursuant to any written or oral agreement, arrangement, relationship, understanding, or otherwise with any person that would have been an interested shareholder at the effective time of the amendment if this section had been applicable.",
