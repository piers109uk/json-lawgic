The contract must specify the responsibilities of each party and, where both parties share responsibility for a particular function, must specify the division of the responsibilities. The contract must include the following minimum provisions:\n(a) The insurer may terminate the contract for cause upon written notice to the managing general agent.

A managing general agent shall deposit only trust funds in a trust account and shall not commingle personal funds or other funds in a trust account, except that a managing general agent may deposit and maintain a sum in a trust account from personal funds, which sum shall be specifically identified and used to pay service charges or satisfy the minimum balance requirements relating to the trust account.\n(d) Separate records of business written by the managing general agent must be maintained. The insurer shall have access to and the right to copy all accounts and records related to its business in a form usable by the insurer, and the commissioner shall have access to all books, bank accounts, and records of the managing general agent in a form usable to the commissioner.

The insurer may suspend the settlement authority during the pendency of any dispute regarding the cause for termination.\n(h) Where electronic claims files are in existence, the contract must address the timely transmission of the data.\n(i) If the contract provides for a sharing of interim profits by the managing general agent, and the managing general agent has the authority to determine the amount of the interim profits by establishing loss reserves or controlling claim payments, or in any other manner, interim profits will not be paid to the managing general agent until one year after they are earned for property insurance business and five years after they are earned on casualty business and not until the profits have been verified as provided under section 60H.05.\n(j) The managing general agent shall not:\n(1) bind reinsurance or retrocessions on behalf of the insurer, except that the managing general agent may bind facultative reinsurance contracts pursuant to obligatory facultative agreements if the contract with the insurer contains reinsurance underwriting guidelines including, for both reinsurance assumed and ceded, a list of reinsurers with which the automatic agreements are in effect, the coverage and amounts or percentages that may be reinsured, and commission schedules;\n(2) commit the insurer to participate in insurance or reinsurance syndicates;\n(3) appoint an agent without assuring that the agent is lawfully licensed to transact the type of insurance for which that person is appointed;\n(4) without prior approval of the insurer, pay or commit the insurer to pay a claim over a specified amount, net of reinsurance, which shall not exceed one percent of the insurer's policyholder's surplus as of December 31 of the last completed calendar year;\n(5) collect any payment from a reinsurer or commit the insurer to any claim settlement with a reinsurer, without prior approval of the insurer.
