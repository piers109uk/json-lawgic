	"text": "For purposes of this section, \"facility\" has the meaning provided in United States Code, title 42, section 263b(a)(3)(A).\nA facility at which a mammography examination is performed shall, if a patient is categorized by the facility as having heterogeneously dense breasts or extremely dense breasts based on the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System established by the American College of Radiology, include in the summary of the written report that is sent to the patient, as required by the federal Mammography Quality Standards Act, United States Code, title 42, section 263b, notice that the patient has dense breast tissue, that this may make it more difficult to detect cancer on a mammogram, and that it may increase her risk of breast cancer. The following language may be used:\n\"Your mammogram shows that your breast tissue is dense. Dense breast tissue is relatively common and is found in more than 40 percent of women. However, dense breast tissue may make it more difficult to identify precancerous lesions or cancer through a mammogram and may also be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. This information about the results of your mammogram is given to you to raise your own awareness and to help inform your conversations with your treating clinician who has received a report of your mammogram results. Together you can decide which screening options are right for you based on your mammogram results, individual risk factors, or physical examination.\"",
