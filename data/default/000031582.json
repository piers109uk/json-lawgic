The auditor shall list the property and correct the corresponding items in the return made by the assessor. No statement may be received from any person who refused or neglected to attest to the statement when required by the assessor. No statement may be received from any person, unless the person makes and files with it an affidavit of absence from the town or district without design to avoid the listing of the property, or was prevented by sickness from giving the assessor the required statement when asked to do so.",
