Such written request shall be presented to the clerk, recording officer, or chief administrative officer of the political subdivision or instrumentality, before being presented to the state auditor, who shall determine whether the same is signed by a majority of the members of such governing body and, if found to be so signed, shall certify such fact, and the fact that such resolution was passed, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence thereof in any action or proceedings for the recovery of the costs, charges and expenses of any examination made pursuant to such request. Nothing contained in any of the laws of the state relating to the state auditor, shall be so construed as to prevent any political subdivision from employing a certified public accountant to examine its books, records, accounts, and affairs. For the purposes of this section, the governing body of a town is the town board.",
