	"text": "(a) If an individual who intends to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction dies during the period between the transfer of a gamete or embryo and the birth of the child, the individual's death does not preclude the establishment of the individual's parentage of the child if the individual otherwise would be a parent of the child under this chapter.\n(b) If an individual who consented in a record to assisted reproduction by an individual who agreed to give birth to a child dies before a transfer of gametes or embryos, the deceased individual is a parent of a child conceived by the assisted reproduction only if:\n(1) either:\n(i) the individual consented in a record that if assisted reproduction were to occur after the death of the individual, the individual would be a parent of the child; or\n(ii) the individual's intent to be a parent of a child conceived by assisted reproduction after the individual's death is established by clear and convincing evidence; and\n(2) either:\n(i) the embryo is in utero not later than 36 months after the individual's death; or\n(ii) the child is born not later than 45 months after the individual's death.",
