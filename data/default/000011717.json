	"text": "If it is necessary to construct a drainage project at or near the boundary between this state and another state or country and the work cannot be done in a proper manner without extending the drainage project into the adjoining state or country, the drainage authority may join with the board or tribunal of the adjoining state or country having jurisdiction to plan and construct public drainage systems. The drainage authority in this state may enter into contracts or arrangements with the board or tribunal of the adjoining state or country to construct the drainage project. The proceeding and construction related to property in this state and, as applicable, the drainage authority in relation to the joint drainage work, are governed by this chapter.\nThe adjoining county or district in another state or country must pay its proper share of the necessary costs of the construction of any drainage work including damages. If the benefits to property in the adjoining state or country are not sufficient to pay all the costs of construction of the drainage project in that state or country, including damages, the drainage authority may authorize or direct the affected counties to contribute sufficient funds to complete the construction of the drainage project in the adjoining state or country, if the construction will be of sufficient benefit to the affected property in this state to warrant the contribution.",
