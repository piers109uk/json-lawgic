Upon request from a client or a client's legal representative, a social worker must provide in a timely manner a written payment plan or a written explanation of the charges for any services rendered.\n(b) When providing services authorized or required by law to a client who does not have the capacity to provide consent and who does not have a legal representative, a social worker may submit reasonable bills to an appropriate payer for services provided.\nA social worker must not bill for services that have not been provided except that, with prior notice to the client, a social worker may bill for failed appointments or for cancellations without sufficient notice.
