It shall also include the pursuit of a person suspected of having committed a supposed felony, though no felony has actually been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed. Fresh pursuit, as used therein, shall not necessarily imply instant pursuit, but pursuit without unreasonable delay.",
