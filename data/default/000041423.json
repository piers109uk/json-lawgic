Either the city or the county may pay for these services made from a joint fund established under the exclusive control of either the city or the county. If the agreement provides that one subdivision of government shall pay a joint obligation in full, it may provide that the other subdivision shall discharge its part of the joint obligation by paying its share of the obligation to the subdivision first paying the obligation in full.",
