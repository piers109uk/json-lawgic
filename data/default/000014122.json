	"text": "The Great Lakes protection fund has been created by the governors of the eight Great Lakes states as a nonprofit corporation under the laws of the state of Illinois. The fund is a permanent endowment whose purpose is to advance the principles, goals, and objectives of the Great Lakes toxic substances control agreement executed by the governors of the eight Great Lakes states in May 1986 and to ensure the continuous development of needed scientific information, new cleanup technologies, and innovative methods of managing pollution problems as a cooperative effort in the Great Lakes region. The governor may enter this state as a member of the Great Lakes protection fund and do all things necessary or incidental to participate in the fund, as spelled out in its articles of incorporation, filed with the Illinois secretary of state on or about September 26, 1989, and its bylaws, as amended through September 26, 1989. If congressional consent to the Great Lakes protection fund carries with it conditions that materially change the provisions agreed to by the party states, this state reserves the option to terminate further participation in the fund.",
