If the member that is required to provide coverage by the facility makes such an offer after giving 30 days' advance written notice to the agent of record before making the offer, the member shall have no further obligation to the agent of record.\nAt least annually, every member shall review every private passenger nonfleet applicant which it insures through the facility and determine whether or not such applicant is acceptable for voluntary insurance at a rate lower than the facility rate. If such applicant is acceptable, the member shall make an offer to insure the applicant under voluntary coverage at such lower rate.",
