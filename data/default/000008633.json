If a person dies as a result of intentionally causing or attempting to cause injury to self, survivors are not entitled to basic or optional economic loss benefits for loss arising from the death. A person intentionally causes or attempts to cause injury if the person acts or fails to act for the purpose of causing injury or with knowledge that injury is substantially certain to follow. A person does not intentionally cause or attempt to cause injury (1) merely because the act or failure to act is intentional or done with the realization that it creates a grave risk of causing injury or (2) if the act or omission causing the injury is for the purpose of averting bodily harm to the person or another person.",
