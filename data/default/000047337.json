	"text": "(a) A trustee who conducts a business or other activity as a sole proprietor may establish and maintain a separate account for the transactions of the business or other activity, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets, if the trustee determines that it is in the best interest of all the beneficiaries to establish a separate account instead of accounting for the business or other activity as part of the trust's general accounting records.\n(b) A trustee who establishes a separate account for a business or other activity shall determine the extent to which its net cash receipts will be retained in the separate account for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets, and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity or will be transferred out of the separate account and accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records as the trustee reasonably and equitably determines. If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, and determines that any portion of the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business, the trustee shall transfer that portion out of the separate account and shall account for that portion as principal in the trust's general accounting records.\n(c) A trustee may not account separately for a traditional securities portfolio to avoid the provisions of sections 501C.1101 to 501C.1118 that otherwise apply to securities.\nIf a trustee does not maintain a separate account for a business or other activity conducted as a sole proprietorship, the net profits of the sole proprietorship in any fiscal or calendar year, as reasonably and equitably determined by the trustee, must be allocated to income while any net loss in that year must be charged to principal and must not be carried into any other fiscal or calendar year for purposes of calculating net income.",
