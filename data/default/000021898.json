	"text": "One or more owners may dedicate land for a road or cartway by making application therefor in writing to the town board, describing the land, the purpose of its dedication, and filing the application with the clerk. The clerk shall present the same to the town board which, within ten days after the filing, may pass a resolution declaring the land described to be a public road or cartway. When so declared the land shall be deemed duly dedicated for the purpose expressed in the application and no damages shall be assessed or allowed therefor.\nAny person owning land to exceed 40 acres constituting part of an island within any meandered lake may at personal expense erect a bridge across such portion of the lake as may separate the person's land from the nearest town road on shore, provided the structure shall not interfere with the use of that part of the lake for the passage of such watercraft as would otherwise pass that point. Before proceeding with the construction of the bridge, proper plans and specifications therefor shall be prepared and submitted to and approved by the town board of the town in which the bridge is to be constructed. If public waters are involved, the plans shall first be approved by the commissioner of natural resources. Upon the completion of the bridge in accordance with the plans and specifications, the town board shall approve the same and endorse its approval upon the plans and specifications therefor; and thereupon the same shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the town in which the bridge is located and the bridge shall thereupon become a part of the town road and open to the use of the public as such.",
