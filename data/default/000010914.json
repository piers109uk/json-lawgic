	"title": "92.501 LEASING LANDS TO FARM WILD RICE.",
	"text": "The commissioner of natural resources in consultation with the commissioner of agriculture may, at a public or private lease sale and at the prices and under the terms and conditions the commissioners may prescribe, lease any state-owned lands under the commissioner's jurisdiction and control for the purpose of farming of wild rice. Priority must be given to lands which are accessible and adjacent to existing wild rice production areas and requested for leasing by wild rice producers. The term of a lease under this section must be offered for a minimum of 20 years but may be for a shorter period at the option of the lessee. If a lease is issued prior to the adoption of the rules for the implementation of this section and for a period of less than 20 years, the lease must be converted to a minimum 20-year lease after the rules have been adopted, at the option of the lessee. Leases must be accepted or denied within 60 days of application. If a lease is denied, written notice must be given stating reasons for denial. The lease rate must be adjusted every five years to reflect market values. The money received from the leases under this section must be credited to the account that receives the proceeds of a sale of the land.\nThe commissioner of natural resources and the commissioner of agriculture shall prepare a plan that designates state land for wild rice production including an inventory of the number of acres of land appropriate and suitable for wild rice development and leasing in each county. Proposed mineral exploration does not exempt land from being designated for wild rice development.\nThe commissioner of natural resources may adopt rules to implement this section.",
