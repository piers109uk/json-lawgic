	"text": "A city or municipal power agency may contract for the planning, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, operation, maintenance, repair, extension, and improvement of generation and transmission facilities outside of its corporate limits or those of its members, or may contract with other public or private owners of these facilities to perform these functions, without advertising for bids, preparing final plans and specifications in advance of construction, or securing performance and payment bonds, except to the extent that its governing body determines that these actions are desirable in furtherance of the purposes of sections 453.51 to 453.62. Except as otherwise provided by this section, no contract shall be invalid or unenforceable by reason of nonperformance of the conditions required by any other law relating to public contracts. If a payment bond is secured as provided in section 574.26, it shall be enforceable as provided in sections 574.28 to 574.31, and no lien may be filed under chapter 514 for the furnishing of labor, skill, material, or machinery for the improvement covered thereby.",
