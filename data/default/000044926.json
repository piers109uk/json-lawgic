	"text": "Land that is needed for future street purposes or for aviation purposes and as sites for other necessary public facilities and services is frequently diverted to nonpublic uses that could have been located on other lands without hardship or inconvenience to the owners. When this happens, public uses of land may be denied or may be obtained later only at prohibitive cost or at the expense of dislocating the owners and occupants of the land. Identification on an official map of land needed for future public uses permits both the public and private property owners to adjust their building plans equitably and conveniently before investments are made that will make adjustments difficult to accomplish.\nAfter the planning agency has adopted a major thoroughfare plan and a community facilities plan, it may, for the purpose of carrying out the policies of the major thoroughfare plan and community facilities plan, prepare and recommend to the governing body a proposed official map covering the entire municipality or any portion thereof. The governing body may, after holding a public hearing, adopt and amend the official map by ordinance. A notice of the time, place and purpose of the hearing shall be published in the official newspaper of the municipality at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The official map or maps shall be prepared in sufficient detail to permit the establishment of the future acquisition lines on the ground. In unplatted areas a minimum of a centerline survey shall have been made prior to the preparation of the final draft of the official map. The accuracy of the future acquisition lines shown on the official map shall be attested to by a licensed land surveyor. After adoption, a copy of the official map, or sections thereof with a copy of the adopting ordinance attached shall be recorded with the county recorder as provided in sections 462.351 to 462.364.\nAfter an official map has been adopted and filed, the issuance of building permits by the municipality is subject to this section. Whenever any street or highway is widened or improved or any new street is opened, or interests in lands for other public purposes, including aviation purposes, are acquired by the municipality, it is not required in such proceedings to pay for any building or structure placed without a permit or in violation of conditions of a permit within the limits of the mapped street or outside of any building line that may have been established upon the existing street or within any area thus identified for public purposes. The adoption of an official map does not give the municipality any right, title, or interest in areas identified for public purposes thereon, but the adoption of the map does authorize the municipality to acquire interests without paying compensation for buildings or structures erected in those areas without a permit or in violation of the conditions of a permit.\nIf a land use or zoning permit or approval for a building in such location is denied, the board of appeals and adjustments shall have the power, upon appeal filed with it by the owner of the land, to grant a permit or approval for building in such location in any case in which the board finds, upon the evidence and the arguments presented to it, (a) that the entire property of the appellant of which such area identified for public purposes forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner unless such a permit or approval is granted, and (b) that balancing the interest of the municipality in preserving the integrity of the official map and of the comprehensive municipal plan and the interest of the owner of the property in the use of the property and in the benefits of ownership, the grant of such permit or approval is required by considerations of justice and equity. In addition to the notice of hearing required by section 462.354, subdivision 2, a notice shall be published in the official newspaper once at least ten days before the day of the hearing. If the board of appeals and adjustments authorizes the issuance of a permit or approval the governing body or other board or commission having jurisdiction shall have six months from the date of the decision of the board to institute proceedings to acquire such land or interest therein, and if no such proceedings are started within that time, the officer responsible for issuing permits or approvals shall issue the permit or approval if the application otherwise conforms to local ordinances. The board shall specify the exact location, ground area, height and other details as to the extent and character of the building for which the permit or approval is granted.",
