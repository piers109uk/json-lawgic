	"text": "(a) Products that are deficient in plant food content are subject to this subdivision.\n(b) An analysis must show that a fertilizer is deficient:\n(1) in one or more of its guaranteed primary plant nutrients beyond the investigational allowances and compensations as established by regulation; or\n(2) if the overall index value of the fertilizer is shown below the level established by rule.\n(c) A deficiency in an official sample of mixed fertilizer resulting from nonuniformity is not distinguishable from a deficiency due to actual plant nutrient shortage and is properly subject to official action.\n(d) For the purpose of determining the commercial index value to be applied, the commissioner shall determine at least annually the values per unit of nitrogen, available phosphate, and soluble potash in fertilizers in this state.\n(e) If a fertilizer in the possession of the consumer is found by the commissioner to be short in weight, the registrant or licensee of the fertilizer must submit a penalty payment of two times the value of the actual shortage to the consumer within 30 days after official notice from the commissioner.",
