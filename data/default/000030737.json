The purpose of the trial home visit is to provide sufficient planning for supports and services to the child and family to meet the child's needs following treatment so that the child can return to and remain in the parent's home. During the period of the trial home visit, the agency has placement and care responsibility for the child. The trial home visit shall not exceed six months and may be terminated by either the parent or the agency within ten days' written notice.",
