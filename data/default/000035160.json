	"text": "The board may fix a date not more than 60 days, or a shorter time period provided in the articles or bylaws, before the date of a meeting of members as the date for the determination of the members entitled to notice of and entitled to vote at the meeting. When a date is so fixed, only members with voting rights on that date are entitled to notice of and permitted to vote at that meeting of members.\n(a) A determination of members entitled to notice and to vote at a membership meeting is effective for an adjournment of the meeting unless the board fixes a new date for determining the right to notice and to vote, which it must do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than 60 days after the record date for determining members entitled to notice of the original meeting.\n(b) If a court orders a meeting adjourned to a date more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, it may provide that the original record date for notice and voting continues in effect or it may fix a new record date for notice and voting.",
