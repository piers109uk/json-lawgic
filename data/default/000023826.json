There shall be paid to the physician or facility where the employee may be received the same fee for the maintenance and care of the employee as is received by the facility for the maintenance and care of a nonresident patient, and the fees shall be paid by the state, county or city in whose employment the police officer was hired and working at the time the police officer contracted the tuberculosis. The police officer shall receive full hospital care and medical care without cost for the duration of the infection of tuberculosis or any recurrence thereof or any disability resulting therefrom. Further, the Workers' Compensation Division shall order payment to the police officer by the state, county or city concerned, of the compensation provided for under the general provisions of the workers' compensation law, including benefits to dependents as defined by the workers' compensation law, if the police officer dies from the effects of the disease of tuberculosis and if the tuberculosis was the primary infection and the authentic cause of death.",
