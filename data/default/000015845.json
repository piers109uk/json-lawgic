	"text": "The commissioner of children, youth, and families must award grants for Grow Your Own Early Childhood Educator programs established under this section in order to develop an early childhood education workforce that more closely reflects the state's increasingly diverse student population and ensures all students have equitable access to high-quality early educators.\n(a) Minnesota-licensed family child care or licensed center-based child care programs, school district or charter school early learning programs, Head Start programs, institutions of higher education, and other community partnership nongovernmental organizations may apply for a grant to host, build, or expand an early childhood educator preparation program that leads to an individual earning the credential or degree needed to enter or advance in the early childhood education workforce. Examples include programs that help interested individuals earn the child development associate (CDA) credential, an associate's degree in child development, or a bachelor's degree in early childhood and family education studies or early childhood licensures. The grant recipient must use at least 80 percent of grant money for student stipends, tuition scholarships, or unique student teaching or field placement experiences.\n(b) Programs providing financial support to interested individuals may require a commitment from the individuals awarded, as determined by the commissioner, to teach in the program or school for a reasonable amount of time that does not exceed one year.\n(a) Eligible programs must apply for a grant under this section in the form and manner specified by the commissioner.
