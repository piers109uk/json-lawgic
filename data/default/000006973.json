This paragraph shall not be construed to alter present law but is intended to clarify present law.\n(b) A life insurance policy or certificate issued or delivered in this state may exclude or restrict liability for any death benefit in the event the insured dies as a result of suicide within one year from the date of the issue of the policy or certificate. Any exclusion or restriction shall be clearly stated in the policy or certificate. Any life insurance policy or certificate which contains any exclusion or restriction under this paragraph shall also provide that in the event any death benefit is denied because the insured dies as a result of suicide within one year from the date of issue of the policy or certificate, the insurer shall refund all premiums paid for coverage providing the denied death benefit on the insured.",
