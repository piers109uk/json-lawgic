	"text": "(a) The declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which period a declarant, or persons designated by the declarant, may elect the members of the board of directors. Any period of declarant control extends from the date of the first conveyance of a unit to a unit owner other than a declarant for a period not exceeding five years in the case of a flexible condominium or three years in the case of any other condominium. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates upon surrender of control by the declarant or no later than 60 days after conveyance of 75 percent of the units to unit owners other than a declarant.\n(b) Not later than 60 days after conveyance of 50 percent of the units to unit owners other than a declarant not less than 33-1/3 percent of all of the members of the board of directors shall be elected by unit owners other than the declarant.\n(c) Not later than the termination of the period of declarant control and thereafter the unit owners shall elect a board of directors of at least three members, at least a majority of whom shall be unit owners or the individual nominees of unit owners other than individuals. The board of directors shall elect the officers. The persons elected shall take office upon election.\n(d) In determining whether the period of declarant control has terminated under subsection (a), or whether unit owners other than a declarant are entitled to elect members of the board of directors under subsection (b), the percentage of the units which has been conveyed is presumed to be that percentage which would have been conveyed if all the units which the declarant has built or reserved the right to build in the declaration were included in the condominium.",
