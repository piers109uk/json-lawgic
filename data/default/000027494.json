	"text": "The commissioner of corrections may permit a contingent account to remain in the hands of the accounting officer of any such institution from which expenditures may be made in case of actual emergency requiring immediate payment to prevent loss or danger to the institution or its inmates and for the purpose of paying freight, purchasing produce, livestock and other commodities requiring a cash settlement, and for the purpose of discounting bills incurred, but in all cases subject to revision by the commissioner of corrections. An itemized statement of every expenditure made during the month from such account shall be submitted to the commissioner under rules established by the commissioner. If necessary, the commissioner shall make proper requisition upon the commissioner of management and budget for a payment to secure the contingent account for each institution.\nThe commissioner of corrections shall collect a damage deposit from all staff who reside in housing on the grounds of the Thistledew Corrections Camp at Togo, Minnesota and deposit the moneys in a savings account in a bank at interest. Withdrawals therefrom may be made to defray the cost of any damage to the residence caused by the tenant or to return the deposit to the tenant with accrued interest if the residence is vacated without damage. The commissioner shall keep accurate records in the name of each tenant so that the interest may be credited to the proper account.",
