	"text": "(a) When a sentence for an offense includes imprisonment in a county jail, the court may sentence the offender to imprisonment in a workhouse or correctional or work farm if there is one in the county where the offender is tried or where the offense was committed. If not, the court may sentence the offender to imprisonment in a workhouse or correctional or work farm in any county in this state. However, the county board of the county where the offender is tried shall have some agreement for the receipt, maintenance, and confinement of inmates with the county where the offender has been sentenced to imprisonment. The place of imprisonment must be specified in the sentence. Inmates may be removed from one place of confinement to another as provided by statute.\n(b) If a court orders or a sheriff permits an offender to serve any portion of the offender's sentence on electronic surveillance, the court or sheriff may require that the offender be kept in custody, or that the offender's probation agent directly supervise the offender until electronic surveillance is activated.\n(c) It is the responsibility of the offender placed on electronic surveillance to ensure that the offender's residence is properly equipped and the offender's telecommunications system is properly configured to support electronic surveillance prior to being released from custody or the direct supervision of a probation agent. An offender who fails to comply with this paragraph may be found in violation of the offender's conditions of release after a revocation hearing.",
