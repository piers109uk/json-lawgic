	"text": "Nothing contained in sections 65A.08 and 65A.09 shall be construed to preclude insurance against the cost, in excess of actual cash value at the time any loss or damage occurs, of actually repairing, rebuilding or replacing the insured property. Subject to any applicable policy limits, where an insurer offers replacement cost insurance: (i) the insurance must cover the cost of replacing, rebuilding, or repairing any loss or damaged property in accordance with the minimum code as required by state or local authorities; and (ii) the insurance coverage may not be conditioned on replacing or rebuilding the damaged property at its original location on the owner's property if the structure must be relocated because of zoning or land use regulations of state or local government. In the case of a partial loss, unless more extensive coverage is otherwise specified in the policy, this coverage applies only to the damaged portion of the property.\nSubject to applicable policy limits, replacement cost insurance coverage for personal property must cover the cost of replacing or repairing any loss or damaged property. In the case of a partial loss, unless more extensive coverage is otherwise specified in the policy, this coverage applies only to the damaged portion of the property. If a homeowner's policy does not provide replacement cost coverage for personal property, the declarations page of the policy shall so indicate by containing the term \"nonreplacement cost.\"",
