The commission may specify the method of acquisition as a condition of its consent.\nIn case of acquisition by purchase or gift, the state's consent shall be obtained before the execution of any instrument conveying the lands involved or any interest in them to the United States. In case of condemnation, consent shall be obtained before the commencement of a condemnation proceeding.",
