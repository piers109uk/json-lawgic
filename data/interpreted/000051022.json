  "text": "In all cases of appeal from a county board to the district court upon the allowance or disallowance of claims, in all actions begun in the district court, in all cases of appeal or writ of error to remove a cause or proceeding to the court of appeals or the supreme court, and in all cases of special or equitable proceedings in the district court, the court of appeals, or the supreme court, the filing or service, or both, as may be required, of an undertaking, signed by a surety or sureties, as the law may require, containing a condition substantially the same as required for bonds, with like sureties, qualifications, and justifications, and without acknowledgment or signature of the principal, shall be deemed a sufficient compliance with the law to sustain the action, appeal, or proceeding. Every undertaking shall save and secure all rights and liabilities to the same extent as a bond. The damages presumed to accrue to the party against whom the proceeding is taken shall be deemed a sufficient consideration for the undertaking, though no consideration is mentioned in it. No undertaking or bond need be given upon any appeal or other proceeding instituted in favor of the state, or any county, city, town, or school district in it, or of any executor or administrator as such.",
