  "text": "This section is the \"Local Interim Emergency Succession Act.\"\nBecause of the existing possibility of a nuclear attack or a natural disaster requiring the declaration of a state of emergency, it is found urgent and necessary to insure the continuity of duly elected and lawful leadership of the political subdivisions of the state.\nThe governing body of any county or municipality may enact ordinances or resolutions as necessary to provide for the continuity of its government and the emergency interim succession of its key government officials. The ordinances and resolutions shall provide a method for temporary emergency appointments to local public offices.\nAn \"interim emergency successor,\" when designated by the governing body of a political subdivision under subdivision 3 shall exercise that office until the duly elected or appointed officer resumes the office or a successor is designated as required by law.",
