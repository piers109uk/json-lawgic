# Json Lawgic

An experiment to express the law as [json-logic](https://jsonlogic.com/)

## Motivation

I want to see if there's an enhanced and innovative way to express the law.
My motivation for doing this is best expressed here: https://www.concordtech.dev/blog/law-expression#motivation

## Data extraction

To see how I fetched the data, see the [law scraper project](https://github.com/piers109uk/law-scraper)

## TO DO

- [ ] Try running model fast locally https://llama-cpp-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/macos/
- [ ] Instrument with Langfuse
- [ ] Law search & selector
- [ ] Visual editor with Blockly just like https://github.com/katirasole/JSONLogic-Editor (see https://katirasole.github.io/JSONLogic-Editor/ )
