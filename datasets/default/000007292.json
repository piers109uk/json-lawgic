	"text": "Sections 62C.01 to 62C.23 may be cited as the \"Nonprofit Health Service Plan Corporations Act.\"\nIt is the purpose and intent of Laws 1971, chapter 568 to promote a wider, more economical and timely availability of hospital, medical-surgical, dental, and other health services for the people of Minnesota, through nonprofit, prepaid health service plans, and thereby advance public health and the art and science of medical and health care within the state, while reasonably regulating the formation, continuation, operation, and termination of such service plans by establishment and enforcement of reasonable and practical standards of administration, investments, surplus and reserves.\nEvery foreign or domestic nonprofit corporation organized for the purpose of establishing or operating a health service plan in Minnesota whereby health services are provided to subscribers to the plan under a contract with the corporation shall be subject to and governed by Laws 1971, chapter 568, and shall not be subject to the laws of this state relating to insurance, except the gross premiums tax provisions contained in chapter 297I and as otherwise specifically provided. Laws 1971, chapter 568 shall apply to all health service plan corporations incorporated after August 1, 1971, and to all existing health service plan corporations, except as otherwise provided. Nothing in sections 62C.01 to 62C.23 shall apply to prepaid group practice plans. A prepaid group practice plan is any plan or arrangement other than a service plan, whereby health services are rendered to certain patients by providers who devote their professional effort primarily to members or patients of the plan, and whereby the recipients of health services pay for the services on a regular, periodic basis, not on a fee for service basis.",
