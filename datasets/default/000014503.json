	"text": "(a) A capital access program is created in the Department of Employment and Economic Development. The purpose of the capital access program is to provide capital to businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, to foster economic development. Capital may be provided in the form of equity investments for community development venture capital funds or loans for all other assistance under the program. Loans made under this program are to be slightly riskier than conventional loans, but still offer a high degree of soundness in connection with the capital access program.\n(b) The commissioner has the power to administer the program, enter into contracts, and take action reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the program. The lender shall provide the commissioner with information regarding its participation in the program as the commissioner may reasonably require. Upon notice to the lender, the commissioner may inspect the files of the lender relating to any loans enrolled under the program during normal business hours of the lender.\n(c) A lender is eligible to participate in the program upon entering into an agreement with the commissioner governing the duties of the commissioner and the lender under the program.",
