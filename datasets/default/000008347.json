	"text": "After the date of filing any such resolution with the commissioner, the company shall not make or declare or pay in any form any dividend upon its capital stock, exceeding eight percent per annum thereupon and six percent per annum upon the surplus funds to be formed hereunder, until after its guaranty surplus fund and its special reserve fund shall have together accumulated to an amount equal to its capital stock or to the sum of $2,000,000; and any part of the surplus profits of the company above this annual dividend may be equally divided between and set apart to constitute the guaranty surplus fund and the special reserve fund, which funds shall be held and used as hereinafter provided, and not otherwise. Any company doing business under sections 65A.16 to 65A.24, whose guaranty surplus fund and special reserve fund shall have together accumulated to an amount equal to its capital stock or to the sum of $2,000,000, may, from time to time, declare dividends out of its surplus profits in such amounts as its board of directors may prescribe, subject only to the limitation that the payment of these dividends shall not deplete its capital, nor reduce the aggregate amount of the guaranty surplus and special reserve funds to an amount less than the amount of its capital stock, or if its capital stock exceeds $2,000,000, to an amount less than $2,000,000; and, subject to the further limitation that no dividends exceeding ten percent upon the capital stock shall be declared in any year if the payment thereof would reduce the aggregate amount of all surplus funds, including guaranty surplus and special reserve funds, below an amount equal to 30 percent of its unearned premiums. Any company doing business under sections 65A.16 to 65A.24, which shall declare or pay any dividend contrary to the provisions herein contained, shall be liable to be proceeded against under chapter 60B for its dissolution.",
