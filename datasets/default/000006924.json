Upon the written request of the commissioner, the insurer shall provide additional information, documents, records, or other data pertaining to the termination or activity of the producer.\nAn insurer or authorized representative of the insurer that terminates the appointment, employment, or contract with a producer for any reason not set forth in section 60K.43 shall notify the commissioner within 30 days following the effective date of the termination, using a format acceptable to the commissioner. Upon written request of the commissioner, the insurer shall provide additional information, documents, records, or other data pertaining to the termination.\nThe insurer or the authorized representative of the insurer shall promptly notify the commissioner in a format acceptable to the commissioner if, upon further review or investigation, the insurer discovers additional information that would have been reportable to the commissioner under subdivision 1 had the insurer then known of its existence.\n(a) Within 15 days after making the notification required by subdivisions 1 to 3, the insurer shall mail a copy of the notification to the producer at the producer's last known address. If the producer is terminated for cause for any of the reasons listed in section 60K.43, the insurer shall provide a copy of the notification to the producer at the producer's last known address by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by overnight delivery using a nationally recognized carrier.\n(b) Within 30 days after the producer has received the original or additional notification, the producer may file written comments concerning the substance of the notification with the commissioner. The producer shall, by the same means, simultaneously send a copy of the comments to the reporting insurer. The comments become a part of the commissioner's file and must accompany every copy of a report distributed or disclosed for any reason about the producer as permitted under subdivision 6.\n(a) In the absence of actual malice, an insurer, the authorized representative of the insurer, a producer, the commissioner, or an organization of which the commissioner is a member and that compiles the information and makes it available to other insurance commissioners or regulatory or law enforcement agencies is not subject to civil liability, and no civil cause of action arises against these entities or their respective agents or employees, as a result of any statement or information required by or provided pursuant to this section or any information relating to any statement that may be requested in writing by the commissioner, from an insurer or producer.
