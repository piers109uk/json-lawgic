If an applicant requests a refund of an overpayment, the request must be received by the commissioner within six months of the date of deposit or the overpayment will be forfeited. An overpayment of a fee may be returned to the person entitled to it upon determination by the commissioner that an overpayment was made.\nAn application that is incomplete is considered withdrawn if the applicant does not submit a complete application within six months of the date the application was received. The application fee is nonrefundable if an application is withdrawn according to this subdivision.",
