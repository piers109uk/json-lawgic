	"text": "Radioactive waste management facilities for spent nuclear fuel or high-level radioactive wastes must be designed to provide a reasonable expectation that the undisturbed performance of the radioactive waste management facility will not cause the radionuclide concentrations, averaged over any year, in groundwater to exceed:\n(1) five picocuries per liter of radium-226 and radium-228;\n(2) 15 picocuries per liter of alpha-emitting radionuclides including radium-226 and radium-228, but excluding radon; or\n(3) the combined concentrations of radionuclides that emit either beta or gamma radiation that would produce an annual dose equivalent to the total body of any internal organ greater than four millirems per year if an individual consumed two liters per day of drinking water from the groundwater.\nThe location or construction of a radioactive waste management facility for high-level radioactive waste is prohibited where the average annual radionuclide concentrations in groundwater before construction of the facility exceed the limits in subdivision 1.\nRadioactive waste management facilities must be selected, located, and designed to keep any allowable radionuclide releases to the groundwater as low as reasonably achievable.",
