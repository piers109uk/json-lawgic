	"text": "A county or multicounty authority and its commissioners shall, within the area of operation of the authority, have the same functions, rights, powers, duties, privileges, immunities, and limitations as are provided for housing and redevelopment authorities created for cities, and for the commissioners of those authorities. The provisions of law applicable to housing and redevelopment authorities created for cities and their commissioners shall be applicable to county and multicounty authorities and their commissioners, except as clearly indicated otherwise.\nWhen a county or multicounty authority undertakes any housing project or housing development project involving the acquisition of multifamily housing rental properties that (1) were financed under the federal Section 8 or Section 236 programs, or (2) are designed to be affordable to persons or families with incomes not greater than 80 percent of median income for the metropolitan statistical area or nonmetropolitan county, and are located within any city or town, the authority shall notify the governing body of the city or town in writing of the location of the housing project or housing development project. If the governing body fails to take action on a housing project or housing development project in a writing which sets forth its reasons for the action within 30 days, the governing body is considered to have approved the location of the housing project or housing development project for purposes of any special or general law requiring local approval of the location of housing projects and housing development projects undertaken by county or multicounty authorities.",
