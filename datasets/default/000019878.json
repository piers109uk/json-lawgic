	"text": "The legislature finds that building materials containing urea formaldehyde may emit unsafe levels of formaldehyde in newly constructed housing units. The product standards prescribed in section 325F.181 are intended to provide indoor air levels of formaldehyde that do not exceed 0.4 parts per million. If the commissioner of health determines that the standards prescribed in section 325F.181 result in indoor air levels of formaldehyde that exceed 0.4 parts per million, the commissioner may adopt different building materials product standards to ensure that the 0.4 parts per million level is not exceeded. The commissioner may adopt rules under chapter 14 to establish product standards as provided in this section. The rules of the commissioner governing ambient air levels of formaldehyde, Minnesota Rules, parts 4620.1600 to 4620.2100, are repealed, except that the rule of the commissioner relating to new installations of urea formaldehyde foam insulation in residential housing units remains in effect.",
