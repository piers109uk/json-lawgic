The drainage lien is a first and paramount lien until fully paid, and has priority over all mortgages, charges, encumbrances, and other liens, unless the board subordinates the drainage lien to liens of record. The recording of the drainage lien, drainage lien statement, or a supplemental drainage lien statement is notice to all parties of the existence of the drainage lien.",
