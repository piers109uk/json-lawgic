In the case of a drug wholesale distributor facility located outside of the state, the board may require the applicant to pay the cost of the inspection, in addition to the license fee in section 151.065, unless the applicant furnishes the board with a report, issued by the appropriate regulatory agency of the state in which the facility is located, of an inspection that has occurred within the 24 months immediately preceding receipt of the license application by the board, or furnishes the board with proof of current accreditation. The board may deny licensure unless the applicant submits documentation satisfactory to the board that any deficiencies noted in an inspection report have been corrected.\n(h) As a condition for receiving and retaining a wholesale drug distributor license issued under this section, an applicant shall satisfy the board that it:\n(1) has adequate storage conditions and facilities to allow for the safe receipt, storage, handling, and sale of drugs;\n(2) has minimum liability and other insurance as may be required under any applicable federal or state law;\n(3) has a functioning security system that includes an after-hours central alarm or comparable entry detection capability, and security policies and procedures that include provisions for restricted access to the premises, comprehensive employee applicant screening, and safeguards against all forms of employee theft;\n(4) will maintain appropriate records of the distribution of drugs, which shall be kept for a minimum of two years and be made available to the board upon request;\n(5) employs principals and other persons, including officers, directors, primary shareholders, and key management executives, who will at all times demonstrate and maintain their capability of conducting business in conformity with state and federal law, at least one of whom will serve as the primary designated representative for each licensed facility and who will be responsible for ensuring that the facility operates in a manner consistent with state and federal law;\n(6) will ensure that all personnel have sufficient education, training, and experience, in any combination, so that they may perform assigned duties in a manner that maintains the quality, safety, and security of drugs;\n(7) will provide the board with updated information about each wholesale distributor facility to be licensed, as requested by the board;\n(8) will develop and, as necessary, update written policies and procedures that assure reasonable wholesale drug distributor preparation for, protection against, and handling of any facility security or operation problems, including but not limited to those caused by natural disaster or government emergency, inventory inaccuracies or drug shipping and receiving, outdated drugs, appropriate handling of returned goods, and drug recalls;\n(9) will have sufficient policies and procedures in place for the inspection of all incoming and outgoing drug shipments;\n(10) will operate in compliance with all state and federal requirements applicable to wholesale drug distribution; and\n(11) will meet the requirements for inspections found in this subdivision.\n(i) An agent or employee of any licensed wholesale drug distributor need not seek licensure under this section. Paragraphs (i) to (p) apply to wholesaler personnel.\n(j) The board is authorized to and shall require fingerprint-based criminal background checks of facility managers or designated representatives, as required under United States Code, title 21, section 360eee-2. The criminal background checks shall be conducted as provided in section 214.075.

The board may make a claim against the bond if the licensee fails to pay a civil penalty within 30 days after the order imposing the fine or costs become final.\n(p) A single surety bond shall satisfy the requirement for the submission of a bond for all licensed wholesale distributor facilities under common ownership.\n[Repealed, 2013 c 108 art 10 s 13]\nIt is unlawful for any person engaged in wholesale drug distribution to sell drugs to a person located within the state or to receive drugs in reverse distribution from a person located within the state except as provided in this chapter.",
