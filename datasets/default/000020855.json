	"text": "Except as provided in section 149A.01, subdivision 3, a place or premise shall not be maintained, managed, or operated which is devoted to or used in the holding and alkaline hydrolysis of a dead human body without possessing a valid license to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility issued by the commissioner of health.\n(a) An alkaline hydrolysis facility licensed under this section must consist of:\n(1) a building or structure that complies with applicable local and state building codes, zoning laws and ordinances, and wastewater management and environmental standards, containing one or more alkaline hydrolysis vessels for the alkaline hydrolysis of dead human bodies;\n(2) a method approved by the commissioner of health to dry the hydrolyzed remains and which is located within the licensed facility;\n(3) a means approved by the commissioner of health for refrigeration of dead human bodies awaiting alkaline hydrolysis;\n(4) an appropriate means of processing hydrolyzed remains to a granulated appearance appropriate for final disposition; and\n(5) an appropriate holding facility for dead human bodies awaiting alkaline hydrolysis.\n(b) An alkaline hydrolysis facility licensed under this section may also contain a display room for funeral goods.\nAn application to license and operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility shall be submitted to the commissioner of health. A completed application includes:\n(1) a completed application form, as provided by the commissioner;\n(2) proof of business form and ownership;\n(3) proof of liability insurance coverage or other financial documentation, as determined by the commissioner, that demonstrates the applicant's ability to respond in damages for liability arising from the ownership, maintenance management, or operation of an alkaline hydrolysis facility; and\n(4) copies of wastewater and other environmental regulatory permits and environmental regulatory licenses necessary to conduct operations.\nUpon receipt of the application and appropriate fee, the commissioner shall review and verify all information. Upon completion of the verification process and resolution of any deficiencies in the application information, the commissioner shall conduct an initial inspection of the premises to be licensed. After the inspection and resolution of any deficiencies found and any reinspections as may be necessary, the commissioner shall make a determination, based on all the information available, to grant or deny licensure. If the commissioner's determination is to grant the license, the applicant shall be notified and the license shall issue and remain valid for a period prescribed on the license, but not to exceed one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license. If the commissioner's determination is to deny the license, the commissioner must notify the applicant in writing of the denial and provide the specific reason for denial.\nA license to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility is not assignable or transferable and shall not be valid for any entity other than the one named. Each license issued to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility is valid only for the location identified on the license. A 50 percent or more change in ownership or location of the alkaline hydrolysis facility automatically terminates the license. Separate licenses shall be required of two or more persons or other legal entities operating from the same location.\nEach license to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility must be conspicuously displayed in the alkaline hydrolysis facility at all times. Conspicuous display means in a location where a member of the general public within the alkaline hydrolysis facility is able to observe and read the license.\nAll licenses to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility issued by the commissioner are valid for a period of one calendar year beginning on July 1 and ending on June 30, regardless of the date of issuance.\nAny change of license information must be reported to the commissioner, on forms provided by the commissioner, no later than 30 calendar days after the change occurs. Failure to report changes is grounds for disciplinary action.\nIf the licensee is operating under a wastewater or an environmental permit or license that is subsequently revoked, denied, or terminated, the licensee shall notify the commissioner.\nAll information submitted to the commissioner for a license to operate an alkaline hydrolysis facility is classified as licensing data under section 13.41, subdivision 5.",
