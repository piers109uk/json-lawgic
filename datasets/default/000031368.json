Seized property acquired by the state of Minnesota to satisfy unpaid taxes shall be resold by the commissioner. The commissioner shall preserve the value of seized property while controlling it, including but not limited to the procurement of insurance.

All amounts deposited into this account are appropriated to the commissioner. The commissioner shall report annually on the status of this program to the chairs and ranking minority members of the legislative committees having jurisdiction over taxes and finance of the house of representatives and senate.",
