In addition, good cause exists whenever:\n(1) without the consent of the farm equipment manufacturer who shall not withhold consent unreasonably, (a) the farm equipment dealer has transferred an interest in the farm equipment dealership, or (b) there has been a withdrawal from the dealership of an individual proprietor, partner, major shareholder, or the manager of the dealership, or (c) there has been a substantial reduction in interest of a partner or major stockholder;\n(2) the farm equipment dealer has filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or has had an involuntary petition in bankruptcy filed against it which has not been discharged within 30 days after the filing, or there has been a closeout or sale of a substantial part of the dealer's assets related to the farm equipment business, or there has been a commencement of dissolution or liquidation of the dealer;\n(3) there has been a change, without the prior written approval of the manufacturer, in the location of the dealer's principal place of business under the dealership agreement;\n(4) the farm equipment dealer has defaulted under a chattel mortgage or other security agreement between the dealer and the farm equipment manufacturer, or there has been a revocation or discontinuance of a guarantee of the dealer's present or future obligations to the farm equipment manufacturer;\n(5) the farm equipment dealer has failed to operate in the normal course of business for seven consecutive days or has otherwise abandoned the business;\n(6) the farm equipment dealer has pleaded guilty to or has been convicted of a felony affecting the relationship between the dealer and manufacturer;\n(7) the dealer has engaged in conduct which is injurious or detrimental to the dealer's customers or to the public welfare; or\n(8) the farm equipment dealer, after receiving notice from the manufacturer of its requirements for reasonable market penetration based on the manufacturer's experience in other comparable marketing areas, consistently fails to meet the manufacturer's market penetration requirements.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subdivision, a farm equipment manufacturer shall provide a farm equipment dealer at least 90 days' prior written notice of termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal of the dealership agreement. The notice shall state all reasons constituting good cause for the action and shall provide that the dealer has 60 days in which to cure any claimed deficiency. If the deficiency is rectified within 60 days, the notice is void. The notice and right to cure provisions under this section do not apply if the reason for termination, cancellation, or nonrenewal is for any reason set forth in subdivision 1, clauses (1) to (7).",
