The notice may be served personally or by mail.\n(d) A licensee or applicant must provide the licensee's or applicant's Social Security number and Minnesota business identification number on all license applications. Upon request of the commissioner of revenue, the board must provide to the commissioner of revenue a list of all licensees and applicants that includes the licensee's or applicant's name, address, Social Security number, and business identification number.
