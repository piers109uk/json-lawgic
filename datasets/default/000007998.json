	"text": "(a) Home care nursing services, as provided under section 256B.0625, subdivision 7, with the exception of section 256B.0654, subdivision 4, shall be covered under a health plan for persons who are concurrently covered by both the health plan and enrolled in medical assistance under chapter 256B.\n(b) For purposes of this section, a period of home care nursing services may be subject to the co-payment, coinsurance, deductible, or other enrollee cost-sharing requirements that apply under the health plan. Cost-sharing requirements for home care nursing services must not place a greater financial burden on the insured or enrollee than those requirements applied by the health plan to other similar services or benefits. Nothing in this section is intended to prevent a health plan company from requiring prior authorization by the health plan company for such services as required by section 256B.0625, subdivision 7, or use of contracted providers under the applicable provisions of the health plan.",
