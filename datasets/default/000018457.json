	"text": "The Board of Regents is encouraged to offer students a guaranteed tuition plan that can provide students a tuition option designed to meet the goals in this section. A Minnesota resident student who first enrolls in a degree program at the University of Minnesota beginning in the spring of 2012 or later may be offered guaranteed stable tuition for up to four consecutive academic years. Under the guaranteed plan, for an undergraduate student enrolled in a baccalaureate degree program, the tuition charged to the student for each semester of enrollment during a four-year period, beginning with the first semester of enrollment, must not exceed the amount of tuition that the student was charged for the first semester of enrollment. For a student who continues to be enrolled after four consecutive academic years, the tuition rate for each semester in excess of four years is equal to the tuition rate paid by new enrollees at the University of Minnesota. Time limits for the stable tuition plan under this section do not apply to a student in the military while the student is on active military duty.",
