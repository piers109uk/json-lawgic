	"text": "As used in this section, an \"old contribution\" is a contribution reflected in the required records of a cooperative before the time the cooperative accepts a new contribution.\nWhenever a cooperative accepts a new contribution, the board shall restate, as required by this section, the value of all old contributions.\n(a) Unless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, this subdivision sets forth the method of restating the value of old contributions that pertain to the same series or class to which the new contribution pertains. To restate the value:\n(1) state the value the cooperative has accorded to the new contribution under section 308B.701, subdivision 3, clause (1);\n(2) determine what percentage the value stated under clause (1) will constitute, after the restatement required by this subdivision, of the total value of all contributions that pertain to the particular series or class to which the new contribution pertains;\n(3) divide the value stated under clause (1) by the percentage determined under clause (2), yielding the total value, after the restatement required by this subdivision, of all contributions pertaining to the particular series or class;\n(4) subtract the value stated under clause (1) from the value determined under clause (3), yielding the total value, after the restatement required by this subdivision, of all the old contributions pertaining to the particular series or class;\n(5) subtract the value, as reflected in the required records before the restatement required by this subdivision, of the old contributions from the value determined under clause (4), yielding the value to be allocated among and added to the old contributions pertaining to the particular series or class; and\n(6) allocate the value determined under clause (5) proportionally among the old contributions pertaining to the particular series or class, add the allocated values to those old contributions, and change the required records accordingly.\n(b) The values determined under paragraph (a), clause (5), and allocated and added under paragraph (a), clause (6), may be positive, negative, or zero.\nUnless otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, this subdivision sets forth the method of restating the value of old contributions that do not pertain to the same series or class to which the new contribution pertains. To restate the value:\n(1) determine the percentage by which the restatement under subdivision 3 has changed the total contribution value reflected in the required records for the series or class to which the new contribution pertains; and\n(2) as to each old contribution that does not pertain to the same series or class to which the new contribution pertains, change the value reflected in the required records by the percentage determined under clause (1). The percentage determined under clause (1) may be positive, negative, or zero.\nIf a cooperative accepts more than one contribution pertaining to the same series or class at the same time, then for the purpose of the restatement required by this section, the cooperative may consider all the new contributions a single contribution.",
