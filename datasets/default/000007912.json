The commissioner shall communicate with regulatory authorities in neighboring states to explore the feasibility of cooperative approaches to streamline regulation of border community networks, such as joint financial audits, and shall report to the legislature on any changes to Minnesota law that may be needed to implement appropriate collaborative approaches to regulation.",
