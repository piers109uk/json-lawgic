	"text": "The annual meeting of the corporation must be held at the parish church or parish house, if there is either, on Easter Monday of each year, or at a time set by the parish in its articles of incorporation. At the annual meeting church wardens and vestry members must be elected, in a manner determined by the parish, by electors with the qualifications prescribed by the canons of the Protestant Episcopal church for the diocese or missionary district in which the corporation is located. A parish organized under this law may, at any annual meeting, adopt a bylaw providing for the election of one-third of the vestry members of the parish for one year, one-third for two years, and one-third for three years, and at the meeting may elect vestry members in accordance with the bylaw. At each succeeding annual meeting one-third of the vestry members must be elected for a term of three years. The bylaws may also provide that no vestry member, at the expiration of the member's term of office, is eligible for reelection to the vestry until the next annual meeting. The church wardens and vestry members shall hold office until successors are elected.\nThe rector of the parish is ex officio a member, and, when present, the presiding officer of the vestry, and entitled to vote at its meetings. Meetings may be called by the rector at the rector's discretion, or by either warden at the request of a majority of the vestry members, on three days' notice, in writing, to each member of the vestry.",
