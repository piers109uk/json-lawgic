Delivery of a shipment under this section may not be deemed a sale in this state.\n(b) The shipping container of any wine sent under this section must be clearly marked \"Alcoholic Beverages: adult signature (over 21 years of age) required.\"\n(c) It is not the intent of this section to impair the distribution of wine through distributors or importing distributors, but only to permit shipments of wine for personal use.\n(d) No criminal penalty may be imposed on a person for a violation of this section other than a violation described in paragraph (e) or (f). Whenever it appears to the commissioner that any person has engaged in any act or practice constituting a violation of this section, and the violation is not within two years of any previous violation of this section, the commissioner shall issue and cause to be served upon the person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from violating this section.

All hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 14. If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person shall be deemed in default, and the proceeding may be determined against the person upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true.\n(e) Any person who violates this section within two years of a violation for which a cease and desist order was issued under paragraph (d), is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n(f) Any person who commits a third or subsequent violation of this section within any subsequent two-year period is guilty of a gross misdemeanor.",
