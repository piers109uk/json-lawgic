	"text": "(a) If the court finds that a guardian is not effectively performing the guardian's duties and that the welfare of the person subject to guardianship requires immediate action, it may appoint a temporary substitute guardian for the person subject to guardianship for a specified period not exceeding six months. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, a temporary substitute guardian so appointed has the powers set forth in the previous order of appointment. The authority of any unlimited or limited guardian previously appointed by the court is suspended as long as a temporary substitute guardian has authority. If an appointment is made without previous notice to the person subject to guardianship or the affected guardian, within five days after the appointment, the court shall inform the person subject to guardianship or guardian of the appointment.\n(b) The court may remove a temporary substitute guardian at any time. A temporary substitute guardian shall make any report the court requires. In other respects, the provisions of this article concerning guardians apply to a temporary substitute guardian.",
