	"text": "(a) If a residential tenant abandons a dwelling unit during the lease term, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent it at a fair rental value. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the agreement is terminated on the date the new tenancy begins. The rental agreement is terminated by the landlord on the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment if the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental value or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender. The tenant shall not be liable for rent after the termination of the tenancy.\n(b) If the rental agreement was for a periodic tenancy or tenancy at will, the maximum rent liability for the tenant is the notice period required to end the lease from the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment.\nAny waiver of the rights provided by this section shall be void and unenforceable.",
