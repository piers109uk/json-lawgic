	"text": "Each county auditor shall keep a register in which shall be entered, as to each issue of such obligations by any municipality located, in whole or in part, in the county, a record of the aggregate amount authorized, the aggregate amount issued, the purpose for which issued, the number, denomination, date, and maturity of each, the rate of interest, the time of payment, the place of payment of principal and interest, and the amount of tax levied for the payment thereof. The auditor shall also enter in said register the date and amount of each debt service loan and capital loan made by the state to any school district situated wholly or partly within the county, in accordance with section 126C.68, subdivision 2, or 126C.69, subdivision 12, and shall enter on or before November 1 in each year thereafter the amount of the maximum effort debt service levy and the additional amount of the levy for interest on state loans to be extended on the tax rolls in that year, as certified by the commissioner of education in accordance with sections 126C.68, subdivision 4, and 126C.69, subdivision 14. In each such year the auditor shall extend on the tax rolls against all taxable property within each such district either (a) the aggregate amount of all tax levies required by section 475.61 to be so extended in such year, less the principal amount of any new debt service loan granted in the current year, or (b) the maximum effort debt service levy of the district as certified by the commissioner of education, if greater than the levy required by the preceding clause (a); adding in either case (c) the amount of the levy for interest on state loans as certified by the commissioner of education, including interest on any new debt service loan granted in the current year. If the school district is situated in more than one county, the aggregate levy shall be apportioned among the counties as provided in section 475.61, subdivision 2, by the county auditor of the county in which is situated the largest portion by net tax capacity of the taxable property within the school district.",
