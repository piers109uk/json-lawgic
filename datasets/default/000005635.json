If the new account is subject to different terms, the financial institution must obtain the written consent of at least one of the deposit account holders before the new terms become effective.\n(b) No financial institution shall initiate a closure of a deposit account without first sending at least one of the deposit account holders a notice of intent to close the deposit account. The notice must be sent to the deposit account holder's last known address on file with the financial institution at least 30 days before the financial institution closes the deposit account; except that, if the financial institution has reasonable suspicion to believe that account is being used in connection with a check-related fraud or other crime or that funds will not be available to pay items drawn on the account, the notice may be sent the same day as the account is closed.\n(c) As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings given them. \"Deposit account\" means a contract of deposit of funds between a depositor and a financial institution, and includes a checking account, savings account, certificate of deposit share account, and other like arrangement. \"Financial institution\" means any organization authorized to do business under state or federal laws relating to financial institutions, including, without limitation, banks and trust companies, savings banks, savings associations, industrial loan and thrift companies, and credit unions.",
