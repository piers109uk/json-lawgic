	"text": "The legislature finds that individuals attempting to escape from actual or threatened domestic violence, sexual assault, or harassment or stalking frequently establish new addresses in order to prevent their assailants or probable assailants from finding them. The purpose of this chapter is to enable state and local agencies to respond to requests for data without disclosing the location of a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, or harassment or stalking; to enable interagency cooperation with the secretary of state in providing address confidentiality for victims of domestic violence, sexual assault, or harassment or stalking; and to enable program participants to use an address designated by the secretary of state as a substitute mailing address for all purposes.",
