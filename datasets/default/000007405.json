	"text": "The association shall submit to the commissioner any premiums it proposes to become effective for coverage under the comprehensive health insurance plan, pursuant to section 62E.08, subdivision 3. No later than 45 days before the effective date for premiums specified in section 62E.08, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall approve, modify, or reject the proposed premiums on the basis of the following criteria:\n(a) whether the association has complied with the provisions of section 62E.11, subdivision 11;\n(b) whether the association has submitted the proposed premiums in a manner which provides sufficient time for individuals covered under the comprehensive insurance plan to receive notice of any premium increase no less than 30 days prior to the effective date of the increase;\n(c) the degree to which the association's computations and conclusions are consistent with section 62E.08;\n(d) the degree to which any sample used to compute a weighted average by the association pursuant to section 62E.08 reasonably reflects circumstances projected to exist in the private marketplace for individual coverage through the use of accepted actuarial principles during the period to which the association's rates will apply;\n(e) the degree to which a weighted average computed pursuant to section 62E.08 that uses information pertaining to individual coverage available only on a renewal basis reflects the circumstances projected to exist through the use of accepted actuarial principles, in the private marketplace for individual coverage during the period to which the association's rates will apply;\n(f) a comparison of the proposed increases with increases in the cost of medical care and increases projected to occur through the use of accepted actuarial principles in the private marketplace for individual coverage during the period to which the association's rates will apply;\n(g) the financial consequences to enrollees of the proposed increase;\n(h) the actuarially projected effect of the proposed increase upon both total enrollment in, and the nature of the risks assumed by, the comprehensive health insurance plan;\n(i) the relative solvency of the contributing members; and\n(j) other factors deemed relevant by the commissioner.\nIn no case, however, may the commissioner approve premiums for those plans of coverage described in section 62E.08, subdivision 1, paragraphs (a) to (d), that are lower than 101 percent or greater than 125 percent of the weighted averages computed by the association pursuant to section 62E.08. The commissioner shall support a decision to approve, modify, or reject any premium proposed by the association with written findings and conclusions addressing each criterion specified in this section. If the commissioner does not approve, modify, or reject the premiums proposed by the association sooner than 45 days before the effective date for premiums specified in section 62E.08, subdivision 3, the premiums proposed by the association under this section become effective.",
