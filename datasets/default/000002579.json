Any escrowed proceeds, pending such use, may be invested and reinvested in obligations that are authorized investments under section 11A.24. The income earned or realized on the investment may also be applied to the payment of the bonds to be refunded or interest or premiums on the refunded bonds, or to pay interest on the refunding bonds. After the terms of the escrow have been fully satisfied, any balance of the proceeds and any investment income may be returned to the general fund or, if applicable, the appropriation bond proceeds account for use in any lawful manner.

For this purpose a complaint shall be filed by the commissioner in the Minnesota Supreme Court against the state and the taxpayers and citizens thereof.\n(e) As a condition precedent to filing of a complaint for the validation of appropriation bonds, the commissioner shall take action providing for the issuance of such appropriation bonds in accordance with law.\n(f) The complaint shall set out the state's authority to issue appropriation bonds, the action or proceeding authorizing the issue and its adoption, all other essential proceedings had or taken in connection therewith, the amount of the bonds to be issued and the maximum interest they are to bear, and all other pertinent matters.\n(g) The Minnesota Supreme Court shall issue an order directed against the state and taxpayers, citizens and others having or claiming any right, title, or interest affected by the issuance of appropriation bonds, or to be affected thereby, allowing all persons, in general terms and without naming them, and the state through its attorney general to appear before the Minnesota Supreme Court at a designated time and place and show why the complaint should not be granted and the proceedings and bonds validated. A copy of the complaint and order shall be served on the attorney general at least 20 days before the time fixed for hearing. The attorney general shall examine the complaint, and, if it appears or there is reason to believe that it is defective, insufficient, or untrue, or if in the opinion of the attorney general the issuance of the bonds in question has not been duly authorized, defense shall be made by the attorney general as the attorney general deems appropriate.\n(h) Before the date set for hearing, as directed by the Minnesota Supreme Court, either the clerk of the Minnesota Appellate Courts or the commissioner shall publish a copy of the order in a legal newspaper of general circulation in Ramsey County and the state, at least once each week for two consecutive weeks, commencing with the first publication, which shall not be less than 20 days before the date set for hearing. By this publication, all taxpayers, citizens, and others having or claiming any right, title, or interest in the state, are made parties defendant to the action and the Minnesota Supreme Court has jurisdiction of them to the same extent as if named as defendants in the complaint and personally served with process.\n(i) Any taxpayer, citizen, or person interested may become a party to the action by moving against or pleading to the complaint at or before the time set for hearing. The Minnesota Supreme Court shall determine all questions of law and fact and make such orders as will enable it to properly try and determine the action and render a final judgment within 30 days of the hearing with the least possible delay.\n(j) If the judgment validates such appropriation bonds, such judgment is forever conclusive as to all matters adjudicated and as against all parties affected and all others having or claiming any right, title, or interest affected by the issuance of said bonds, or to be affected in any way thereby, and the validity of said bonds or of any revenues pledged for the payment thereof, or of the proceedings authorizing the issuance thereof, including any remedies provided for their collection, shall never be called in question in any court by any person or party.\n(k)(1) Bonds, when validated under this section, shall have stamped or written thereon, by the proper officers of the state issuing them, a statement in substantially the following form: \"This bond is one of a series of bonds which were validated by judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Minnesota, rendered on ....., (year) ......\"\n(2) A certified copy of the judgment or decree shall be received as evidence in any court in this state.\n(l) The costs shall be paid by the state, except when a taxpayer, citizen, or other person contests the action or intervenes, the court may tax the whole or any part of the costs against the person that is equitable.\n(m) A justice of the Minnesota Supreme Court is not disqualified in any validation action because the justice is a landowner or taxpayer of the state.",
