After payment of the expenses of the receivership and claims of creditors duly proved, the remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed to the shareholders in accordance with section 302A.551, subdivision 4. Every receiver appointed under the provisions of this section shall give bond as required by section 576.27 in such amount as the court shall require, with sureties approved by it.",
