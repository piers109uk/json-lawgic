	"text": "The classification of iron-bearing formations under the provisions of sections 273.14 to 273.16 shall be determined in the manner provided. Any person engaged in the business of mining, whose tonnage recovery of iron ore concentrates for a taxable year in producing concentrates from the iron-bearing material entering the beneficiating plant has been less than 50 percent, may file a petition with the commissioner of revenue requesting classification of the deposit under the provisions of sections 273.14 to 273.16. The taxpayer shall furnish any available data and information concerning the operation of the deposit as the commissioner of revenue requires. The commissioner shall, upon receipt of it, submit the petition and data to the University of Minnesota mines experiment station. The mines experiment station shall consider the deposit referred to in the petition as a unified commercial operation. Based on all engineering data and information furnished, it shall file a written report with the commissioner of revenue, who, after hearing, shall approve or disapprove the report. If a classification is made covering the deposit and property, the commissioner of revenue shall give appropriate notice of it to the taxing districts affected by it. If the commissioner of revenue disapproves of the classification, the commissioner's findings and order on it may be reviewed by the court of appeals on petition of the party aggrieved presented to the court within 30 days after the date of the order. The classifications shall also be subject to further review by the mines experiment station, from time to time, upon request of the commissioner of revenue or upon further petition by the taxpayer. Valuations determined hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of sections 270C.921 to 270C.928.",
