	"text": "A retailer must report the fee on a return prescribed by the commissioner and must remit the fee with the return. The return and fee must be filed and paid using the filing cycle and due dates provided for taxes imposed under chapter 297A.\nA retailer that collects the fee from the purchaser must collect the fee in the same manner as the tax collected under chapter 297A. A retailer using a third-party entity to collect and remit the tax imposed under chapter 297A may elect to have that third-party entity collect and remit the fee imposed under this chapter.\nUnless specifically provided otherwise by this chapter, the audit, assessment, refund, penalty, interest, enforcement, collection remedies, appeal, and administrative provisions of chapters 270C and 289A, that are applicable to taxes imposed under chapter 297A, apply to the fee imposed under this chapter.\nThe commissioner must pay interest on an overpayment refunded or credited to the retailer from the date of payment of the fee until the date the refund is paid or credited. For purposes of this subdivision, the date of payment is the due date of the return or the date of actual payment of the fee, whichever is later.",
