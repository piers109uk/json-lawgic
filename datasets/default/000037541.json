	"text": "The person entitled to the possession of any estray, at any time within one year after notice is filed with the town clerk, may have it restored upon proving the right to it and paying all lawful charges that occur in relation to it. If the person and the finder cannot agree as to the amount of the charges, or upon what should be allowed for the use of the estray, either party, on notice to the other, may apply to a district court judge to settle the disagreement. The judge may examine witnesses on oath. If any amount is owed to the finder, over the value of the use of the estray, the money, with costs, shall be a lien upon the estray. The costs of the adjudication shall be allocated by the judge.",
