	"text": "[Repealed, 1981 c 346 s 145; 1983 c 290 s 15]\nDividend plans are not unfairly discriminatory where different premiums result for different policyholders with similar loss exposures but different expense factors, or where different premiums result for different policyholders with similar expense factors but different loss exposures, so long as the respective premiums reflect the differences with reasonable accuracy. Every insurer who issues participating policies shall file with the commissioner a true copy or summary as the commissioner shall direct of its participating dividend rates as to policyholders. The commissioner may study the participating dividend rates and make recommendations to the legislature concerning possible bases for unfair discrimination.",
