	"text": "The commissioner shall make a case reviewer available to debtors. The reviewer must be available to answer a debtor's questions concerning the collection process and to review the collection activity taken. If the reviewer reasonably believes that the particular action being taken is unreasonable or unfair, the reviewer may make recommendations to the commissioner in regard to the collection action.\nOn application filed by a debtor with the case reviewer, in the form, manner, and in the time prescribed by the commissioner, and after thorough investigation, the case reviewer may issue a debtor assistance order if, in the determination of the case reviewer, the manner in which the state debt collection laws are being administered is creating or will create an unjust and inequitable result for the debtor. Debtor assistance orders are governed by the provisions relating to taxpayer assistance orders under section 270C.37.\nAll duties and authority of the case reviewer under subdivisions 1 and 2 are transferred to the taxpayer rights advocate.",
