	"text": "There is created in each city in this state a public body, corporate and politic, to be known as the housing and redevelopment authority in and for that city. No such authority shall transact any business or exercise any powers until the governing body of the city shall, by resolution, find that in that city (1) substandard, slum, or blighted areas exist which cannot be redeveloped without government assistance, or (2) there is a shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations available to persons of low income and their families at rentals they can afford, and shall declare that there is need for a housing and redevelopment authority to function in that city. In determining whether dwelling accommodations are unsafe or unsanitary, or whether substandard, slum, or blighted areas exist, the governing body may consider the degree of deterioration, obsolescence, or overcrowding, the percentage of land coverage, the light, air, space, and access available to inhabitants of the dwelling accommodations, the size and arrangement of rooms, the sanitary facilities, the extent to which conditions exist in the buildings that endanger life or property by fire or other causes, and the original land planning, lot layout, and conditions of title in the area.\nThe governing body of a city shall consider such a resolution only after a public hearing is held on it after publication of notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city at least once not less than ten days nor more than 30 days prior to the date of the hearing. Opportunity to be heard shall be granted to all residents of the city and to all other interested persons. The resolution shall be published in the same manner in which ordinances are published in the municipality.\nWhen the resolution becomes finally effective, it shall be sufficient and conclusive for all purposes if it declares that there is need for an authority and finds in substantially the terms provided in subdivision 1 that the conditions therein described exist.\nWhen the resolution becomes finally effective, the clerk of the city shall file a certified copy of it with the commissioner of employment and economic development. In any suit, action, or proceeding involving the validity or enforcement of or relating to any contract of an authority, the authority shall be conclusively deemed to have become established and authorized to transact business and exercise its powers upon that filing. Proof of the resolution and of that filing may be made in any such suit, action, or proceeding by a certificate of the commissioner of employment and economic development.\nAn authority shall consist of up to seven commissioners, who shall be residents of the area of operation of the authority, who shall be appointed after the resolution becomes finally effective. If any additional commissioners are appointed, one of the commissioners must be appointed in accordance with the requirements of Code of Federal Regulations, title 24, part 964.\nThe commissioners shall be appointed by the mayor, with the approval of the governing body. Those initially appointed shall be appointed for terms of one, two, three, four, and five years, respectively. Thereafter all commissioners shall be appointed for five-year terms. Each vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled for the remainder of the term for which the original appointment was made. Any member of the governing body of a city may be appointed and may serve as a commissioner of the authority for the city. The council of any city which appoints members of the city council as commissioners may set the terms of office of a commissioner to coincide with the commissioner's term of office as a council member.\nCommissioners shall hold office until their successors have been appointed and qualified. A certificate of appointment of each commissioner shall be filed with the clerk and a certified copy shall be transmitted to the commissioner of employment and economic development. A certificate so filed shall be conclusive evidence of appointment.",
