	"text": "If the United States declines to deal with a county board with respect to any political subdivision whose jurisdictional limits are within or coextensive with the limits of the county, or in the event the jurisdictional limits of a political subdivision lie in more than one county, that subdivision is hereby authorized to make request of the United States for payment of such sums in lieu of taxes as the United States may agree to pay, and is hereby empowered to enter into agreements with the United States for the performance by the subdivision of services for the benefit of a project and for the payment by the United States to the subdivision, in one or more installments of such sums in lieu of taxes. The amount of such payment may be based upon the cost of performing such services during the period of the agreement, after taking into consideration the benefits to be derived by the subdivision from the project, but shall not be in excess of the taxes which would result to the political subdivision during such period if the real property of the project within the political subdivision were taxable. When any payment is received by a subdivision under an agreement entered into pursuant to this section, the governing body of such subdivision shall issue a receipt for such payment.",
