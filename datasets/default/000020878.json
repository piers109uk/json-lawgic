	"text": "This section is effective July 1, 2025. All licenses to operate a natural organic reduction facility issued by the commissioner expire on June 30 following the date of issuance of the license and must be renewed to remain valid.\n(a) Licensees who wish to renew their licenses must submit to the commissioner a completed renewal application no later than June 30 following the date the license was issued. A completed renewal application includes:\n(1) a completed renewal application form, as provided by the commissioner; and\n(2) proof of liability insurance coverage or other financial documentation, as determined by the commissioner, that demonstrates the applicant's ability to respond in damages for liability arising from the ownership, maintenance, management, or operation of a natural organic reduction facility.\n(b) Upon receipt of the completed renewal application, the commissioner shall review and verify the information. Upon completion of the verification process and resolution of any deficiencies in the renewal application information, the commissioner shall make a determination, based on all the information available, to reissue or refuse to reissue the license. If the commissioner's determination is to reissue the license, the applicant shall be notified and the license shall issue and remain valid for a period prescribed on the license, but not to exceed one calendar year from the date of issuance of the license. If the commissioner's determination is to refuse to reissue the license, section 149A.09, subdivision 2, applies.\nRenewal applications received after the expiration date of a license will result in the assessment of a late filing penalty. The late filing penalty must be paid before the reissuance of the license and received by the commissioner no later than 31 calendar days after the expiration date of the license.\nA license to operate a natural organic reduction facility shall automatically lapse when a completed renewal application is not received by the commissioner within 31 calendar days after the expiration date of a license, or a late filing penalty assessed under subdivision 3 is not received by the commissioner within 31 calendar days after the expiration of a license.\nUpon the lapse of a license, the person to whom the license was issued is no longer licensed to operate a natural organic reduction facility in Minnesota. The commissioner shall issue a cease and desist order to prevent the lapsed license holder from operating a natural organic reduction facility in Minnesota and may pursue any additional lawful remedies as justified by the case.\nThe commissioner may restore a lapsed license upon receipt and review of a completed renewal application, receipt of the late filing penalty, and reinspection of the premises, provided that the receipt is made within one calendar year from the expiration date of the lapsed license and the cease and desist order issued by the commissioner has not been violated. If a lapsed license is not restored within one calendar year from the expiration date of the lapsed license, the holder of the lapsed license cannot be relicensed until the requirements in section 149A.56 are met.\nAny change of license information must be reported to the commissioner, on forms provided by the commissioner, no later than 30 calendar days after the change occurs. Failure to report changes is grounds for disciplinary action.\nSection 13.41 applies to data collected and maintained by the commissioner pursuant to this section.",
