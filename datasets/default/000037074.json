	"text": "A lessee who fails to make timely lease payments may reinstate the original rental-purchase agreement without losing any rights or options previously acquired under the rental-purchase agreement if both of the following apply:\n(1) after having failed to make a timely payment, the lessee has surrendered the property to the lessor within seven days of a request to surrender the property made by the lessor as provided in section 325F.89; and\n(2) in the case of a lessee that has paid less than 60 percent of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership of the property, not more than 60 days have passed since the lessee returned the property. If the lessee has paid more than 60 percent of the total of payments necessary to acquire ownership of the property, the lessee's rights to reinstate shall be extended for a period of not less than 180 days after the lessee has returned the property.\nAs a condition to reinstating a rental-purchase agreement, a lessor may charge the outstanding balance of any accrued payments; a reinstatement fee not to exceed $5 for each reinstatement; and a delivery charge not to exceed $15 for five items or less or $30 for more than five items, if redelivery of the item is necessary.\nIf reinstatement occurs as provided in this section, the lessor shall provide the lessee with the same item, if available, leased by the lessee before reinstatement. If the same item is not available, a substitute item of comparable worth, quality, and condition may be used. If a substitute item is provided, the lessor shall provide the lessee with all the information required by section 325F.86.",
