If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing office rule, but in no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record.\n(c) When filed financing statement effective. A filed financing statement satisfying section 336.9-502(a) and (b) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (a).
