	"text": "The tax imposed by this chapter, and interest and penalties imposed with respect to it, is a personal debt of the person required to file a return from the time the liability for it arises, regardless of when the time for payment of the liability occurs. In the case of the executor or administrator of the estate of a decedent and in the case of any fiduciary, the debt is that of the person in the person's official or fiduciary capacity only, unless the person has voluntarily distributed the assets held in that capacity without reserving sufficient assets to pay the tax, interest, and penalties. In that case, the person is personally liable for the deficiency.",
