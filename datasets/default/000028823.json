	"text": "(a) If at the conclusion of a review hearing the court finds that the person continues to have mental illness or chemical dependency and need treatment or supervision, the court shall determine the length of continued commitment. No period of commitment shall exceed this length of time or 12 months, whichever is less.\n(b) At the conclusion of the prescribed period under paragraph (a), commitment may not be continued unless a new petition is filed pursuant to section 253B.07 and hearing and determination made on it. If the petition was filed before the end of the previous commitment and, for good cause shown, the court has not completed the hearing and the determination by the end of the commitment period, the court may for good cause extend the previous commitment for up to 14 days to allow the completion of the hearing and the issuance of the determination. The standard of proof for the new petition is the standard specified in section 253B.12, subdivision 4. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 253B.09, subdivision 5, the initial commitment period under the new petition shall be the probable length of commitment necessary or 12 months, whichever is less.\nIf, at the conclusion of a review hearing the court finds that the person continues to be developmentally disabled, the court shall order commitment of the person for an indeterminate period of time, subject to the reviews required by section 253B.03, subdivisions 5 and 7, and subject to the right of the patient to seek judicial review of continued commitment.\n[Repealed, 1997 c 217 art 1 s 118]",
