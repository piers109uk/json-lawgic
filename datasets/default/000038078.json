	"text": "(1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is\n(a) a \"sale on approval\" if the goods are delivered primarily for use, and\n(b) a \"sale or return\" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.\n(2) Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.\n(3) Any \"or return\" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this article (section 336.2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this article on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 336.2-202).",
