	"text": "The legislature finds that risks to human health must be adequately evaluated before a facility may burn PCBs. The legislature also finds that if there is a risk to human health, all human health must be treated with equal concern, and facilities that cause risks to human health must not be allowed to operate in sparsely populated areas if they would not be allowed to operate in heavily populated areas.\nThe Pollution Control Agency may not allow burning of wastes containing 50 ppm or greater PCBs by permit or otherwise unless an environmental impact statement is completed. It may not renew a permit for burning wastes containing 50 ppm or greater PCBs until an environmental impact statement is completed. This section does not apply to experimental burning of small quantities of waste containing 50 ppm or greater PCBs.",
