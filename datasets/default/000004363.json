If an authorized representative of the commissioner finds such an article or animal on premises where it is held for purposes of, during, or after distribution in intrastate commerce, and there is reason to believe that it is adulterated or misbranded and is usable as human food, or that it has not been inspected, in violation of sections 31A.01 to 31A.16, the Federal Meat Inspection Act, or the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or that the article or animal has been or is intended to be distributed in violation of a provision of those laws, it may be detained by the representative for up to 20 days pending action under section 34A.11, subdivision 2, or notification of federal authorities having jurisdiction over the article or animal. It must not be moved by a person, firm, or corporation from the place at which it is located when detained, until released by the representative. The representative may require all official marks to be removed from the article or animal before it is released unless the commissioner is satisfied that the article or animal is eligible to retain the official marks.",
