Before designating a district, the city must consult with its planning agency or department and must hold a public hearing on the designation. Notice of the hearing must be published in the official newspaper of the city or, if there is no official newspaper, in a newspaper of general distribution in the city. The city shall also provide for relocation pursuant to section 469.133 and consult with the advisory board created by section 469.132 before making this designation.\nWithin these districts the city may:\n(1) adopt a development program consistent with which the city may acquire, construct, reconstruct, improve, alter, extend, operate, maintain, or promote developments aimed at improving the physical facilities, quality of life, and quality of transportation;\n(2) acquire land or easements through negotiation or through powers of eminent domain;\n(3) adopt ordinances regulating traffic in pedestrian skyway systems, public parking structures, and other facilities constructed within the development district.
