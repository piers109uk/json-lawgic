	"text": "The intent of the legislature in sections 352.01, subdivision 25; 353.01, subdivision 37; 354.05, subdivision 38; and 354A.011, subdivision 15a, is to create a normal retirement age for persons first covered by those sections after May 16, 1989, that is the same as the retirement age in the federal Social Security law, including future amendments to that law. If a court determines that the legislature may not incorporate by reference the future changes in federal Social Security law, the legislature reserves the right to amend the appropriate sections to make the normal retirement age conform to the retirement age in the federal Social Security law. No person first covered by any of those sections after May 16, 1989, has a right to a normal retirement age that is less than the retirement age in the federal Social Security law.",
