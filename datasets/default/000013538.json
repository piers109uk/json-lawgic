	"text": "The commissioner may recover under section 115B.17, subdivision 6, that portion of the costs of response actions at any qualified facility attributable to a person who otherwise would be responsible for the release or threatened release under section 115B.03, and whose actions related to the release or threatened release were in violation of federal or state hazardous waste management laws in effect at the time of those actions. The commissioner's determination of the portion of the costs of a response action attributable to a person under this section, based on the volume and toxicity of waste in the facility associated with the person and other factors reasonably related to the contribution of the person to a release or threatened release, is prima facie evidence that those costs are attributable to the person.",
