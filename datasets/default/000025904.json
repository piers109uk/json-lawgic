A rule adopted by the commission must not grant priority to state-owned wildlife management areas over agricultural lands in the designation of route avoidance areas. Chapter 14 applies to the appeal of rules adopted by the commission to the same extent as it applies to review of rules adopted by any other agency of state government.\nThe chief administrative law judge must adopt procedural rules for public hearings relating to the site and route permit process. The rules must attempt to maximize citizen participation in these processes consistent with the time limits for commission decision established under this chapter.",
