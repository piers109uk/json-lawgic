The authority may issue notes partly to renew notes or to discharge other obligations then outstanding and partly for any other purpose. The notes may be authorized, sold, executed and delivered in the same manner as bonds. Any resolution or resolutions authorizing notes of the authority or any issue thereof may contain any provisions which the authority is authorized to include in any resolution or resolutions authorizing revenue bonds of the authority or any issue thereof, and the authority may include in any notes any terms, covenants or conditions which it is authorized to include in any bonds.
