This paragraph does not apply to applicants not qualifying for a certificate who hold themselves out as hearing aid dispensers.\n(c) The penalty fee for practicing prescription hearing aid dispensing and failing to submit a continuing education report by the due date with the correct number or type of hours in the correct time period is $200 plus $200 for each missing clock hour. \"Missing\" means not obtained between the effective and expiration dates of the certificate, the one-month period following the certificate expiration date, or the 30 days following notice of a penalty fee for failing to report all continuing education hours. The certificate holder must obtain the missing number of continuing education hours by the next reporting due date.\n(d) Civil penalties and discipline incurred by certificate holders prior to August 1, 2005, for conduct described in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) shall be recorded as nondisciplinary penalty fees.
