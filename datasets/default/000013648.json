	"text": "(a) The commissioner shall prepare a report concerning the development of a stabilization and containment facility. The report must include:\n(1) a conceptual plan that describes and evaluates the proposed design and operation of the facility, including an evaluation of technical feasibility, a description and evaluation of the types and quantities of hazardous waste and nonhazardous residual waste from hazardous waste processing that the facility would be designed to accept, and a description and evaluation of technologies needed or desired at the facility for processing, stabilization, and containment, including above grade containment;\n(2) procedures and standards for the operation of the facility that require the use of reduction, recycling, and recovery of any hazardous waste before the waste is accepted for stabilization when the alternative or additional management method is feasible and prudent and would materially reduce adverse impact on human health and the environment;\n(3) evaluation of the design and use of the facility for processing, stabilization, or containment of industrial waste, including technical and regulatory issues and alternative management methods;\n(4) evaluation of feasible and prudent technologies that may substantially reduce the possibility of migration of any hazardous constituents of wastes that the facility would be designed to accept;\n(5) a general analysis of the necessary and desirable physical, locational, and other characteristics of a site for the facility;\n(6) an evaluation of the prospects of and conditions required for the regulatory delisting of residual waste from hazardous waste processing;\n(7) an evaluation of the feasibility of an interstate, regional approach to the management of hazardous waste; and\n(8) an economic feasibility analysis of the development and operation of the facility, including the anticipated use of the facility by Minnesota generators from within and outside the state, and sources of private and public financing that may be available or necessary for development or operation.\n(b) The commissioner shall submit a draft of the report to the agency before executing contracts under section 115A.191.",
