The provisions of this section shall apply only to the immediate transaction and if the applicant pays the tax due with respect to the application, this section shall not constitute grounds for refusal to issue plates or a certificate because the tax imposed by this chapter was not paid by a previous applicant in a prior transaction involving the same motor vehicle so long as the present applicant had no actual knowledge of the failure to pay the tax prior to acquiring the vehicle and the previous applicant held a certificate of title indicating the previous applicant was the owner of the vehicle.",
