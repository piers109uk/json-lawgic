	"text": "Before a grant is made, a priority system shall be devised for the selection of projects to receive the aid. The Board of Water and Soil Resources is the granting authority and shall cooperate with the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Natural Resources, the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service and the Area II Action Committee in analysis of the general floodplain management plan for the area and in hydrological and engineering studies on specific proposed sites. From that information, the Board of Water and Soil Resources shall determine the relative severity of the flooding problem which would be wholly or partly solved by each project. The range of priorities based on these findings shall provide a basis for selection of project sites.\nNotwithstanding the requirement in subdivision 1 that project selection be based on a priority system, not more than one project may be located within any one of the Cottonwood, Lac Qui Parle, Redwood, Yellow Medicine, and Yellow Bank Rivers' watersheds unless agreed upon by the Area II Action Committee composed of representatives of each of those watersheds.",
