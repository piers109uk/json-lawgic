	"title": "548.22 CONFESSION OF JUDGMENT.",
	"text": "A judgment for money due or to become due, or to secure any person against a contingent liability on behalf of the defendant, or for both, may be entered in the district court by confession and without action, upon filing with the court administrator a statement, signed and verified by the defendant, authorizing the entry of judgment for a specified sum. If the judgment be for money due or to become due, the writing shall state concisely the facts out of which the debt arose, and show that the sum confessed is justly due or to become due. If the judgment be for the purpose of securing the plaintiff against a contingent liability, the writing shall state concisely the facts constituting the liability, and show that the sum confessed does not exceed the same. The court administrator shall enter judgment for the amount specified, as in other cases, and shall attach the judgment to the statement, which shall constitute the judgment roll. The judgment shall be final, and, unless special provision be made for a stay, execution may issue immediately.",
