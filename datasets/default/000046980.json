	"text": "A charitable trust subject to sections 501B.33 to 501B.45 must file with the attorney general a copy of its federal tax or information return, including all schedules and amendments, submitted by the charitable trust to the Internal Revenue Service for the period covered in the trust's accounting year last completed. If the charitable trust does not file a federal tax or information return, it shall file a balance sheet and a statement of income and expenses for the accounting year last completed.\nThe information required by this section must be filed annually on or before the 15th day of the fifth month following the close of the charitable trust's taxable year as established for federal tax purposes. The time for filing may be extended by application to the attorney general, for up to six months, provided the applicant has requested an extension to file its federal tax return under section 6081 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A charitable trust that files the information required under this subdivision with the attorney general is not required to file the same information with the commissioner of revenue.\nThe attorney general may suspend the filing requirements under subdivision 1 for a particular charitable trust for a reasonable, specifically designated time on written application of the trustee filed with the attorney general. If the filing requirements are suspended, the attorney general shall file in the register of charitable trusts a written statement that the interests of the beneficiaries will not be prejudiced by the suspension and that the information required by this section is not required for proper supervision by the attorney general's office.\nA $25 filing fee shall be paid by every charitable trust filing the information required by this section.",
