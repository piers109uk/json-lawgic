A certification of the CIC plat or supplemental CIC plat, or an amendment to it, under this subsection by an architect is not required if all parts of the CIC plat, supplemental CIC plat, or amendment are prepared by a land surveyor. Certification by the land surveyor or architect does not constitute a guaranty or warranty of the nature, suitability, or quality of construction of any improvements located or to be located in the common interest community.\n(c) A CIC plat for a condominium, or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate, shall show:\n(1) the number of the common interest community, and the boundaries, dimensions, and legally sufficient description of the land included therein;\n(2) the dimensions and location of all existing material structural improvements and roadways;\n(3) the intended location and dimensions of any contemplated common element improvements to be constructed within the common interest community after the filing of the CIC plat, labeled either \"MUST BE BUILT\" or \"NEED NOT BE BUILT\";\n(4) the location and dimensions of any additional real estate, labeled as such, and a legally sufficient description of the additional real estate;\n(5) the extent of any encroachments by or upon any portion of the common interest community;\n(6) the location and dimensions of all recorded easements within the land included in the common interest community burdening any portion of the land;\n(7) the distance and direction between noncontiguous parcels of real estate;\n(8) the location and dimensions of limited common elements, except that with respect to limited common elements described in section 515B.2-102, subsections (d) and (f), only such material limited common elements as porches, balconies, decks, patios, and garages shall be shown;\n(9) the location and dimensions of the front, rear, and side boundaries of each unit and that unit's unit identifier;\n(10) the location and dimensions of the upper and lower boundaries of each unit with reference to an established or assumed datum and that unit's unit identifier;\n(11) a legally sufficient description of any real estate in which the unit owners will own only an estate for years, labeled as \"leasehold real estate\"; and\n(12) any units which may be converted by the declarant to create additional units or common elements identified separately.\n(d) A CIC plat for a planned community either shall comply with subsection (c), or it shall:\n(1) comply with chapter 505, 508, or 508A, as applicable; and\n(2) comply with the applicable subdivision requirements of any governmental authority within whose jurisdiction the planned community is located, subject to the limitations set forth in section 515B.1-106.\n(e) If a declarant adds additional real estate, the declarant shall record a supplemental CIC plat or plats for the real estate being added, conforming to the requirements of this section which apply to the type of common interest community in question. If less than all additional real estate is being added, the supplemental CIC plat for a condominium, a planned community whose CIC plat complies with subsection (c), or a cooperative in which the unit owners' interests are characterized as real estate shall also show the location and dimensions of the remaining portion.\n(f) If, pursuant to section 515B.2-112, a declarant subdivides or converts any unit into two or more units, common elements, or limited common elements, or combines two or more units, the declarant shall record an amendment to the CIC plat showing the location and dimensions of any new units, common elements, or limited common elements thus created.\n(g) A CIC plat that complies with subsection (c) is not subject to chapter 505.\n(h) This section applies only to common interest communities created before August 1, 2010.",
