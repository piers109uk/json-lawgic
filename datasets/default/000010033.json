The money in the consolidated account, or as much of it as necessary, is appropriated for the purposes of sections 84A.52 and 84A.53. Of any remaining balance, the amount derived from timber sales receipts is transferred to the forest management investment account and the amount derived from all other receipts is transferred to the general fund.\nWithin 30 days after the end of each fiscal year the commissioner of management and budget shall pay one-half of the income received in the consolidated account in that fiscal year to the county containing the land from which the income is derived. That amount is so appropriated.\n(a) The funds received by each county must be apportioned by the county auditor as follows:\n(1) 30 percent to a county development fund, which is created, to be spent under the direction of the county board for the rehabilitation and development of the portion of the county within the conservation area;\n(2) 40 percent to the general fund of the school district from which derived;\n(3) 20 percent to the county revenue fund; and\n(4) ten percent to the township road and bridge fund of the township from which derived.\n(b) If the proceeds are derived from an unorganized township with no levy for road and bridge purposes, the township portion must be credited to the county revenue fund.\n[Unnecessary]",
