If such sheriff dies, or from any cause is unable to act, the sheriff in office, upon receipt of any such writ, process, or order, together with the return or memorandum of the action, if any, of such late sheriff under the same, shall complete the execution thereof in the same manner and with like effect as if the same had been originally delivered to the successor and the return of such succeeding sheriff upon any such process or order or sheriff's deed given in pursuance of the execution thereof shall be prima facie evidence of the disability of the late sheriff to complete the execution of such process or give such deed.",
