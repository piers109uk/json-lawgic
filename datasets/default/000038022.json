	"text": "Property in the possession of a museum or archives repository which the museum or archives repository has reason to believe may be on loan and, for which the museum or archives repository does not know the owner, or have any reasonable means of determining the owner, becomes the property of the museum or archives repository if no person has claimed the property within seven years after the museum or archives repository took possession of the property. The museum or archives repository becomes the owner of the property on the day after the seven-year period ends, and after following the notification process outlined in subdivision 2, free from all claims.\nThe museum or archives repository that wishes to acquire title to undocumented property described in subdivision 1 shall provide public notice in the manner described in section 345.72.\nEffective August 1, 2004, property that: (1) is found in or on property controlled by the museum; (2) is from an unknown source; and (3) might reasonably be assumed to have been intended as a gift to the museum, is conclusively presumed to be a gift to the museum if ownership of the property is not claimed by a person within 90 days of its discovery.",
