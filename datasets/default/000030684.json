	"text": "A county attorney may establish a truancy mediation program for the purpose of resolving truancy problems without court action. If a student is in a school district or charter school that has established a school attendance review board, the student may be referred to the county attorney under section 260A.06, subdivision 3. If the student's school district or charter school has not established a board, the student may be referred to the county attorney by the school district or charter school if the student continues to be truant after the parent or guardian has been sent or conveyed the notice under section 260A.03.\nThe county attorney may request the parent or legal guardian and the child referred under subdivision 1 to attend a meeting to discuss the possible legal consequences of the minor's truancy. The notice of the meeting must be served personally or by certified mail at least five days before the meeting on each person required to attend the meeting. The notice must include:\n(1) the name and address of the person to whom the notice is directed;\n(2) the date, time, and place of the meeting;\n(3) the name of the minor classified as a truant;\n(4) the basis for the referral to the county attorney;\n(5) a warning that a criminal complaint may be filed against the parents or guardians pursuant to section 120A.34 for failure to compel the attendance of the minor at school or that action may be taken in juvenile court; and\n(6) a statement that the meeting is voluntary.",
