If any book has marks which show that the items have been transferred to a ledger, it shall not be received unless the ledger is produced. The entry of charges or credits, involving money, goods, chattels, or services furnished or received, when the furnishing or receipt thereof constitutes a part of the usual course of business of the person on whose behalf such entry is made, shall be received as evidence tending to prove the fact of the furnishing or receiving of such moneys, goods, chattels, or services, whether the same be contained in an account book, or in a so-called loose-leaf, card, or similar system of keeping accounts, and whether the same be made by handwriting, typewriting, or other similar means, if it shall appear that such entry was made by a duly authorized person contemporaneously with the transaction therein referred to, as a part of the general system of accounts of the person on whose behalf the entry is made, and that the same is made in the usual and ordinary course of such business.",
