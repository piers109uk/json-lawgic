The termination election must be clear and conspicuous on the website and must use plain language to convey that any consumer may use the termination election to terminate the agreement at any time. The termination election must only require a consumer to input information that is necessary to process the termination. The termination election must include a checkbox, submission button, or similarly common and simple mechanism for the member to indicate a desire to terminate the agreement.\n(b) For purposes of this section, \"termination election\" means a simple and easily accessible means for a consumer to quickly provide notice of termination, and that does not include undue complexity, confusion, or misrepresentation by the seller.",
