	"text": "(a) Express warranties made by a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant to a purchaser of a unit if reasonably relied upon by the purchaser, are created as follows:\n(1) any affirmation of fact or promise which relates to the unit, its use, or rights appurtenant thereto, area improvements to the condominium that would directly benefit the unit, or the right to use or have the benefit of facilities not located in the condominium, creates an express warranty that the unit and related rights and uses will conform to the affirmation or promise;\n(2) any model or description of the physical characteristics of the condominium, including plans and specifications of or for improvements, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the model or description. A notice prominently displayed on a model or description shall prevent a purchaser from reasonably relying upon the model or description to the extent of the disclaimer set forth on the notice;\n(3) any description of the quantity or extent of the real estate comprising the condominium, including plats or surveys, creates an express warranty that the condominium will conform to the description, subject to customary tolerance; and\n(4) a provision that a buyer may put a unit only to a specified use is an express warranty that the specified use is lawful.\n(b) Neither formal words, such as \"warranty\" or \"guarantee,\" nor a specific intention to make a warranty, are necessary to create an express warranty. A statement purporting to be merely an opinion or commendation of the real estate or its value does not create a warranty.\n(c) Any conveyance of a unit transfers to the purchaser all express warranties made by a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant.",
