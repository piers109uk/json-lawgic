In addition, if it is a reciprocal or interinsurance exchange operating on a nonassessable basis, it must establish and maintain a guaranty fund in an amount equal to that which would be required of a mutual company pursuant to section 66A.16, if it were engaged in those same lines of insurance.\nSubdivision 2, as amended by Laws 1969, chapter 820, section 1, shall be effective upon enactment, and thereafter all reciprocal insurance associations shall meet the revised requirements of subdivision 2, as amended by Laws 1969, chapter 820, section 1, provided, however, that any reciprocal insurance association authorized to transact a particular kind or kinds of insurance as specified in section 60A.06, may continue to do so without complying with the revised requirements of subdivision 2, as amended by Laws 1969, chapter 820, section 1. After enactment, any reciprocal insurance association which seeks authority to transact an additional kind or kinds of insurance shall, as a condition to the granting of such authority, comply with the revised requirements of subdivision 2, as amended by Laws 1969, chapter 820, section 1, as to such additional kind or kinds of insurance that it is authorized to transact.\nConcurrently with the filing of the declaration provided for by the terms of subdivision 2, the attorney shall execute and file with the commissioner an instrument in writing for the subscribers, conditioned that upon the issuance of the certificate of authority provided for in subdivision 1, service of process in compliance with section 45.028, subdivision 2, may be had upon the commissioner in all suits in this state arising out of these policies, contracts, or agreements, which service shall be valid and binding upon all subscribers exchanging at any time reciprocal or interinsurance contracts through such attorney.\nThere shall be filed with the commissioner by such attorney a statement under oath showing the maximum amount of indemnity upon any single risk, and such attorney shall, when and as often as the same shall be required, file with the commissioner a statement verified by oath to the effect that the attorney has examined the commercial rating of these subscribers, as shown by the reference book of a commercial agency having at least 100,000 subscribers, and that from this examination or from other information in the attorney's possession it appears that no subscriber has assumed on any single risk an amount greater than ten percent of the net worth of the subscriber.",
