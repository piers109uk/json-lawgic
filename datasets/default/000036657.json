If emailed, cancellation is effective upon transmission.\n(c) A notice of cancellation given by the owner need not take the particular form as provided with the contract.\n(d) Within ten days following receipt of a notice of cancellation given in accordance with this section, the equity purchaser shall return without condition any original contract and any other documents signed by the owner.",
