	"text": "As used in this section:\n(1) \"breath analyzer unit\" means a device that performs breath alcohol testing and is connected to a remote electronic alcohol-monitoring system; and\n(2) \"remote electronic alcohol-monitoring system\" means a system that electronically monitors the alcohol concentration of individuals in their homes or other locations to ensure compliance with conditions of pretrial release, supervised release, or probation.\nIn cooperation with the Conference of Chief Judges, the state court administrator, and the commissioner of public safety, the commissioner of corrections shall establish a program to use breath analyzer units to monitor impaired driving offenders who are ordered to abstain from alcohol use as a condition of pretrial release, supervised release, or probation. The program must include procedures to ensure that violators of this condition of release receive swift consequences for the violation.\nOffenders who are ordered to participate in the program shall also be ordered to pay the per diem cost of the monitoring unless the offender is indigent. The commissioner of corrections shall reimburse the judicial districts in a manner proportional to their use of remote electronic alcohol monitoring for any costs the districts incur in participating in the program.\nBy January 1, 2004, the commissioner of corrections shall evaluate the effectiveness of the program and report the results of this evaluation to the Conference of Chief Judges, the state court administrator, the commissioner of public safety, and the chairs and ranking minority members of the house of representatives and senate committees and divisions having jurisdiction over criminal justice policy and funding.",
