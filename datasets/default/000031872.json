	"text": "If answers be filed within the time hereinbefore prescribed, the issues raised thereby shall stand for trial at any general term of the district court in the county where such proceedings are pending in session when the time to file answers shall expire, or, if the court be not then in session, then at the next general or special term appointed to be held in such county; and, if no such term be appointed to be held within 30 days thereafter, then the same shall be brought to trial at any general term appointed to be held within the judicial district, upon ten days' notice. The county attorney of the county in which such taxes are levied shall take charge of and prosecute such proceedings, but the county board may employ any other attorney to assist the county attorney. At the term at which the proceedings come on for trial, they shall take precedence of all other business before the court. The court shall, without delay and summarily, hear and determine the objections or defenses made by the answers, and shall direct judgment accordingly, and in the trial thereof shall disregard all technicalities and matters of form not affecting the substantial merits.",
