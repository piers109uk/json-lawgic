The claim must be sent to the commissioner accompanied by a transmittal form as prescribed by the commissioner.\nWhen a claim against the state is made by a county, municipality, or other governmental subdivision, under an agreement with the commissioner of transportation, and that agreement provides for payment of the state's contractual obligations before commencing the work, certification that the services have been performed or that the goods or materials have been furnished is not required as a prerequisite to payment of the claim.\nThe commissioner may require a claimant to declare that the claim and its amount are just and correct and that no part of it has been paid. The following form may be used:\n\"I declare under the penalties of perjury that this claim is just and correct and that no part of it has been paid.\nSignature of Claimant.\"\nTo sign the declaration in subdivision 2 is the same as to sign and swear under oath.",
