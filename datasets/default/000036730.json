A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 is not in violation of sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 for the obligations of the controller or processor from which the third-party controller or processor receives the personal data.\n(e) Obligations imposed on controllers and processors under sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 shall not:\n(1) adversely affect the rights or freedoms of any persons, including exercising the right of free speech pursuant to the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; or\n(2) apply to the processing of personal data by a natural person in the course of a purely personal or household activity.\n(f) Personal data that are processed by a controller pursuant to this section may be processed solely to the extent that the processing is:\n(1) necessary, reasonable, and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section;\n(2) adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the specific purpose or purposes listed in this section; and\n(3) insofar as possible, taking into account the nature and purpose of processing the personal data, subjected to reasonable administrative, technical, and physical measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of the personal data, and to reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers.\n(g) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that the processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the requirements in paragraph (f).\n(h) Processing personal data solely for the purposes expressly identified in paragraph (a), clauses (1) to (7), does not, by itself, make an entity a controller with respect to the processing.",
