	"text": "The legislature finds that conciliation conferences pursuant to sections 125A.03 to 125A.24 and 125A.65 serve better than formal hearings to promote communications between parents and school staff and to reach prompt, shared decisions about educational programs for children with a disability. Further, the legislature urges the United States Department of Education and the United States Office of Civil Rights to acknowledge that the conciliation conference process violates no federal statute or regulation.\nThe commissioner shall not adopt any provision in the state plan for special education that reduces the opportunities for parents and school districts to resolve their differences through conciliation.",
