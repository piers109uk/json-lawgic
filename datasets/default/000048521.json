	"text": "(a) If a unit is acquired by eminent domain, or if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain leaving the unit owner with a remnant which may not practically or lawfully be used for any purpose permitted by the declaration, the award shall compensate the unit owner and holders of an interest as security for an obligation in the unit and its common element interest as their interests may appear, whether or not any common element interest is acquired. Upon acquisition, unless the decree otherwise provides, that unit's entire common element interest, votes in the association, and common expense liability are automatically reallocated to the remaining units in proportion to the respective interests, votes, and liabilities of those units prior to the taking, and the association shall promptly prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Any remnant of a unit remaining after part of a unit is taken under this subsection is thereafter a common element.\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (a), if part of a unit is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall compensate the unit owner and the holders of an interest as security for an obligation as their interests may appear for the reduction in value of the unit and its common element interest. Upon acquisition, unless the apportionment thereof pursuant to the declaration is based upon equality, (1) that unit's common element interest, votes in the association, and common expense liability are reduced in proportion to the reduction in the size of the unit, and (2) the portion of common element interest, votes, and common expense liability divested from the partially acquired unit are automatically reallocated to that unit and the remaining units in proportion to the respective interests, votes, and liabilities of those units prior to the taking, with the partially acquired unit participating in the reallocation on the basis of its reduced interests, votes, and liabilities.\n(c) If part of the common elements is acquired by eminent domain, the award shall be paid to the association. The association shall divide any portion of the award not used for any restoration or repair of the remaining common elements among the unit owners and holders of an interest as security for an obligation as their interests may appear in proportion to their respective interests in the common elements before the taking, but the portion of the award attributable to the acquisition of a limited common element shall be equally divided among the owners of the units to which that limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition and the respective holders of an interest as security for an obligation of the units as their interests may appear of the units to which that limited common element was allocated at the time of acquisition, or in such other manner as the declaration may provide.\n(d) The court decree shall be recorded in every county in which any portion of the condominium is located.",
