	"text": "(a) A health carrier must provide on the carrier's website the provider network for each product offered by the carrier, and must update the carrier's website at least once a month with any changes to the carrier's provider network, including provider changes from in-network status to out-of-network status. A health carrier must also provide on the carrier's website, for each product offered by the carrier, a list of the current waivers of the requirements in section 62K.10, subdivision 2 or 3, in a format that is easily accessed and searchable by enrollees and prospective enrollees.\n(b) Upon notification from an enrollee, a health carrier must reprocess any claim for services provided by a provider whose status has changed from in-network to out-of-network as an in-network claim if the service was provided after the network change went into effect but before the change was posted as required under paragraph (a) unless the health carrier notified the enrollee of the network change prior to the service being provided. This paragraph does not apply if the health carrier is able to verify that the health carrier's website displayed the correct provider network status on the health carrier's website at the time the service was provided.\n(c) The limitations of section 62Q.56, subdivision 2a, shall apply to payments required by paragraph (b).",
