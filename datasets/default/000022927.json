	"text": "For the purpose of sections 174.29 and 174.30 \"special transportation service\" means motor vehicle transportation provided on a regular basis by a public or private entity or person that is designed exclusively or primarily to serve individuals who are elderly or disabled and who are unable to use regular means of transportation but do not require ambulance service, as defined in section 144E.001, subdivision 3. Special transportation service includes but is not limited to service provided by specially equipped buses, vans, taxis, and volunteer drivers, as defined in section 65B.472, subdivision 1, paragraph (h), using private automobiles. Special transportation service also means those nonemergency medical transportation services under section 256B.0625, subdivision 17, that are subject to the operating standards for special transportation service under sections 174.29 to 174.30 and Minnesota Rules, chapter 8840.\nIn order to provide more adequate access to transportation service for the elderly and disabled with special transportation needs and to more efficiently utilize public and private funds expended for that purpose, all state agencies that assist, provide, reimburse, or regulate special transportation services shall promote, support, and facilitate coordination of those services with other special services and with regular transportation services offered to the general public.\n[Expired]",
