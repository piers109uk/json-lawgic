A consumer may recover actual damages caused by a violation of section 325G.31 only if the violation caused the consumer to be substantially confused about the rights, obligations or remedies of the contract.\nAny claim that a consumer contract violates section 325G.31 must be raised within six years of the date the contract is executed by the consumer.",
