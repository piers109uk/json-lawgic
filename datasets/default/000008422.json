	"text": "After receiving written notice of a claim by an insured on a homeowner's insurance policy, the insurer may notify the insured that the insurer may deny the claim unless a completed proof of loss is received by the insurer within 60 days of the date on which the written notice under this subdivision was received by the insured. The notice given by the insurer must be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and must include a proof of loss form to be completed by the insured together with accompanying instructions for completing the form. The proof of loss form and the accompanying instructions must meet the readability standards of chapter 72C.\nIn an action for the recovery of a claim on a homeowner's insurance policy, an insured's failure to comply with the 60-day proof of loss requirement:\n(1) is a bar to recovery if the insured received the notice specified in subdivision 1, unless the insured demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that the insured had good cause for failing to comply;\n(2) is not a bar to recovery if the insured did not receive the notice specified in subdivision 1, unless the insurer demonstrates to the court's satisfaction that its rights were prejudiced by the insured's failure to comply.\nFor purposes of this section, the terms \"insurer\" and \"homeowner's insurance\" have the meanings given them in section 65A.27.\nThis section supersedes any inconsistent provision of section 65A.01, 72A.201, or other law.",
