	"title": "149A.45 EMERITUS REGISTRATION FOR MORTUARY SCIENCE PRACTITIONERS.",
	"text": "Any mortuary science practitioner licensed to practice mortuary science in Minnesota under this chapter may apply to the commissioner for mortuary science practitioner emeritus registration if the person declares that he or she is retired in all jurisdictions from the active practice of mortuary science and if the person is not subject to any disciplinary action by the commissioner and not subject to an order by the commissioner imposing a suspended, conditional, or restricted license to practice mortuary science. For purposes of this section, a person is retired if the person has completely ceased the active practice of mortuary science in all jurisdictions for any reason. The mortuary science practitioner may apply to the commissioner using the practitioner's licensure form or by petitioning the commissioner.\nAn emeritus registration is not a license to engage in the practice of mortuary science. A person registered under this section shall not engage in the practice of mortuary science.\nThe continuing education requirements that apply to mortuary science practitioners shall not apply to a person registered under this section.\nA person granted emeritus registration shall, upon payment of a $50 fee, be issued a certificate by the commissioner certifying that the person has received emeritus registration and has completed his or her active professional career licensed in good standing with the commissioner. The $50 fee shall be a onetime fee.\nA person registered under this section shall not be subject to a registration renewal cycle or any renewal fees.\n[Repealed, 2013 c 108 art 12 s 109]\nAfter one year a person who registers under this section may reapply meeting current requirements for licensure listed in section 149A.20.",
