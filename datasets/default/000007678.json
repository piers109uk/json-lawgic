Training sites that receive no public program revenue are ineligible for funds available under this subdivision.\nTraining sites whose training site level grant is less than $5,000, based on the formulas described in this subdivision, or that train fewer than 0.1 FTE eligible trainees, are ineligible for funds available under this subdivision.

Sponsoring institutions, which are accredited through an organization recognized by the Department of Education or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, may contract directly with training sites to provide clinical training. To ensure the quality of clinical training, those accredited sponsoring institutions must:\n(1) develop contracts specifying the terms, expectations, and outcomes of the clinical training conducted at sites; and\n(2) take necessary action if the contract requirements are not met. Action may include disqualifying the training site under this section or the removal of students from the site.\n(e) Use of funds is limited to expenses related to eligible clinical training costs. The commissioner shall develop a methodology for determining eligible costs.\n(f) Any funds that cannot be distributed in accordance with the commissioner's approval letter must be returned to the medical education and research fund within 30 days of receiving notice from the commissioner.
