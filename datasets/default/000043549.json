	"text": "This section applies when all of the volunteer firefighters relief associations involved in the consolidation are defined contribution relief associations as defined in section 424A.001, subdivision 1c.\nThe successor relief association following the consolidation of two or more defined contribution relief associations must be a defined contribution relief association and the successor relief association board shall establish individual accounts for every active member, inactive member, deferred member, or retired member receiving installment payments with that status as of the consolidation date. To each individual account the successor relief association must credit the amount to the credit of each person by a predecessor relief association as of the date of consolidation plus a proportional share, based on account value, of any subsequent net revenue during the consolidation process.\nUnless the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the successor relief association specify that municipal contributions are wholly voluntary or unless the municipalities associated with the consolidating defined contribution relief associations agree in writing to a different municipal support arrangement, each municipality must continue to provide the same amount of municipal support to the successor relief association as the municipality provided to the applicable predecessor relief association in the calendar year immediately prior to the calendar year in which the consolidation occurs.",
