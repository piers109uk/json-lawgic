It may be written in any language, by hand or by any other means.\nThe testator shall declare in the presence of two witnesses and of a person authorized to act in connection with international wills that the document is the testator's will and that the testator knows the contents thereof. The testator need not inform the witnesses or the authorized person of the contents of the will.\nIn the presence of the witnesses and of the authorized person, the testator shall sign the will or, having previously signed it, shall acknowledge the signature.\nIf the testator is unable to sign, the absence of the signature does not affect the validity of the international will if the testator indicates the reason for the inability to sign and the authorized person makes note thereof on the will. In that case, it is permissible for any other person present, including the authorized person or one of the witnesses, at the direction of the testator, to sign the testator's name for the testator if the authorized person makes note of this on the will, but it is not required that any person sign the testator's name for the testator.\nThe witnesses and the authorized person shall there and then attest the will by signing in the presence of the testator.",
