	"text": "(a) It is the policy of the state of Minnesota that any restructuring of executive branch agencies must include efforts to ensure that fair and equitable arrangements are carried out to protect the interests of executive branch employees and to provide the best possible service to the public. The commissioner shall make an effort to train and retrain existing employees for a changing work environment. Where restructuring may involve a loss of existing positions and employment, the commissioner shall assist affected employees in finding suitable employment.\n(b) Options available to employees whose positions will be eliminated by implementation of a restructuring plan must include, at a minimum, job and training opportunities necessary to qualify for another job in the same, an equal, or a lower classification within their current department or in another state agency.\n(c) Implementation of this section, as well as procedures for notifying employees affected by restructuring plans, must be negotiated into collective bargaining agreements under chapter 179A. Nothing in this section shall be construed as diminishing any rights defined in collective bargaining agreements under this chapter or chapter 179A.",
