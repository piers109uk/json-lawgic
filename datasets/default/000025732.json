	"text": "Except as provided in subdivision 2, if a candidate is convicted of violating a provision of this chapter or if an offense was committed by another individual with the knowledge, consent, or connivance of the candidate, the court, after entering the adjudication of guilty, shall enter a supplemental judgment declaring that the candidate has forfeited the nomination or office. If the court enters the supplemental judgment, it shall transmit to the filing officer a transcript of the supplemental judgment, the nomination or office becomes vacant, and the vacancy must be filled as provided by law.\nIn a trial for a violation of this chapter, the candidate's nomination or election is not void if the court finds that:\n(1) an offense, though committed by the candidate or with the candidate's knowledge, consent, or connivance, was trivial; or\n(2) an act or omission of a candidate arose from accidental miscalculation or other reasonable cause, but in any case not from a want of good faith, and that it would be unjust for the candidate to forfeit the nomination or election.\nNeither of these findings is a defense to a conviction under this chapter.",
