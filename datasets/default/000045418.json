The commissioners of a port authority shall not be personally liable as such on its contracts, or for torts, not committed or directly authorized by them. The property or funds of a port authority shall not be subject to attachment, or to levy and sale on execution, but, if a port authority refuses to pay a judgment entered against it in any court of competent jurisdiction, the district court for the county in which the port authority is situated may, by writ of mandamus, direct the treasurer of the authority to pay the judgment from any unencumbered funds available for that purpose.",
