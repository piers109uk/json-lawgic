	"text": "Beginning in 2001, the day of August 7 is designated as Combat Wounded Veterans Day in honor of military veterans who were wounded by enemy action while bravely serving their country against enemy forces, and whose sacrifices have entitled them to the Purple Heart decoration. This decoration was created by General George Washington, commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Army and a founder of our country, on August 7, 1782, and is the oldest military decoration in use in the world. Each year the governor shall issue a proclamation honoring this observance and shall send a written copy to the Minnesota department of the Military Order of the Purple Heart.",
