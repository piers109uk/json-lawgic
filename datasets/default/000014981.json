	"text": "The commissioner of public safety may establish pilot projects at neighborhood centers serving youths between the ages of 11 to 21. The centers may offer recreational activities, social services, meals, job skills and career services, and provide referrals for youths to other available services outside the centers. The commissioner may consult with other appropriate agencies and, to the extent possible, use existing resources and staff in creating the programs. The commissioner shall ensure that the programs, if offered, are adequately staffed by specially trained personnel and outreach street workers. Each center may integrate community volunteers into the program's activities and services and cooperate with local law enforcement agencies. The centers must be open during hours convenient to youths including evenings, weekends, and extended summer hours. However, there may not be any conflicts with truancy laws. Each center must have a plan for evaluation designed to measure the program's effectiveness in aiding youths.\n[Repealed, 2001 c 161 s 58]",
