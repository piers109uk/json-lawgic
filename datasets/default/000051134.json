	"text": "Actions for fines and forfeitures may be prosecuted by the officers or persons to whom they are by law given, or who by special provisions of law are authorized to recover them; and, whether prosecuted by public officers or by private persons, shall be governed by the same rules as other civil actions, except as herein otherwise prescribed. When an action is brought for a penalty, the amount of which is limited by law, it may be brought for the amount so limited, and upon trial the amount recovered shall be in proportion to the offense. Recovery of a judgment for a penalty or forfeiture, by collusion between the parties and with intent to save the defendant from the consequences contemplated by law, where the same is given wholly or partly to the prosecutor, shall not prevent a recovery of the same by another person.",
