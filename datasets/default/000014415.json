	"text": "The legislature finds that a uniform policy on business licenses is necessary to maintain an adequate level of protection of the public welfare while preventing business licensing from becoming overly burdensome for the citizens and businesses of Minnesota.\nIt is the policy of the state of Minnesota that to the extent practicable, when required, a business license:\n(1) should be necessary to protect the safety, health or welfare of the citizens of the state or to ensure fair competition, competency in business, responsible financial practices, or other ethical business conduct;\n(2) should not duplicate or significantly overlap any other business license;\n(3) should be issued and renewed for the longest period possible consistent with the need to review eligibility and compliance with the terms and conditions of the license;\n(4) should contain a termination or renewal date determined by the agency to be as convenient as possible for the license holder consistent with clause (3). When an agency issues more than one license to the same business these licenses should have the same calendar renewal date; and\n(5) should involve payment of a fee in an amount no greater than specified by statute. If a fee is authorized by statute and set by rule, the fee shall be no greater than necessary to recover the administrative cost of issuing or renewing the license or enforcing its terms and conditions. The fees and conditions may be different for different classes of businesses and for initial issuance and subsequent renewals.",
