	"text": "For purposes of section 363A.09, discrimination includes:\n(1) a refusal to permit, at the expense of the disabled person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by the disabled person if modifications may be necessary to afford the disabled person full enjoyment of the premises; a landlord may, where it is reasonable to do so, condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, excluding reasonable wear and tear;\n(2) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when accommodations may be necessary to afford a disabled person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or\n(3) in connection with the design and construction of covered multifamily dwellings for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, a failure to design and construct those dwellings in a manner that:\n(i) the public use and common use portions are readily accessible to and usable by a disabled person;\n(ii) all the doors designed to allow passage into and within all premises are sufficiently wide to allow passage by disabled persons in wheelchairs; and\n(iii) all premises contain the following features of adaptive design: an accessible route into and through the dwelling; light switches, electrical outlets, thermostats, and other environmental controls in accessible locations; reinforcements in bathroom walls to allow later installation of grab bars; and usable kitchens and bathrooms so that an individual in a wheelchair can maneuver about the space.\nAs used in this section, the term \"covered multifamily dwellings\" means:\n(1) a building consisting of four or more units if the building has one or more elevators; and\n(2) ground floor units in other buildings consisting of four or more units.\nThis section does not invalidate or limit any law of the state or political subdivision of the state, or other jurisdiction in which this section applies, that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords disabled persons greater access than is required by this section.\nThis section does not require that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.",
