	"text": "A hospital must not charge a patient whose annual household income is less than $125,000 for any uninsured service or treatment in an amount that exceeds the lowest total amount the provider would be reimbursed for that service or treatment from a nongovernmental third-party payor. The lowest total amount the provider would be reimbursed for that service or treatment from a nongovernmental third-party payor includes both the amount the provider would be reimbursed directly from the nongovernmental third-party payor and the amount the provider would be reimbursed from the insured's policyholder under any applicable co-payments, deductibles, and coinsurance. This statute supersedes the language in the Minnesota Attorney General Hospital Agreement.\nIn addition to the enforcement of this section by the commissioner, the attorney general may enforce this section under section 8.31.",
