	"text": "This section applies to an indoor ice arena operated by a political subdivision, a state agency, the University of Minnesota, a state higher education institution, or any other organization that makes an arena available to the public. If the arena provides more prime ice time to groups of one gender than to groups of the other gender, the arena may not deny a request for prime ice time from the group of the underrepresented gender, provided that the group of the underrepresented gender pays the same price charged to groups of the other gender. An underrepresented gender group must be allowed up to 15 percent of prime ice time for the 1994-1995 season, up to 30 percent by the 1995-1996 season, and up to 50 percent by the 1996-1997 season. This section does not: (1) require an arena to allocate more time to any one group than is generally allocated to other groups; or (2) affect a political subdivision's ability to grant preference to groups based in the political subdivision, provided this preference is not based on gender. For purposes of this section, prime ice time means the hours of 4:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. Monday to Friday and 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Any group that generates revenue as a result of tickets sold to persons in attendance at arena events must be excluded in determining if the arena provides more prime ice time to groups of one gender than the other.",
