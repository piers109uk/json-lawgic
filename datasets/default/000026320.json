	"text": "The commission may initiate action to consider revoking or suspending a permit on the commission's own motion or upon the request of any person who has made a prima facie showing by affidavit and documentation that a violation of this chapter or the permit has occurred.\nIf the commission initiates action to consider revoking or suspending a permit, the commission must provide the permittee with an opportunity for a contested case hearing conducted by an administrative law judge from the Office of Administrative Hearings.\nIf the commission finds that a violation of this chapter or the permit has occurred, the commission may revoke or suspend the permit, require the permittee to undertake corrective or ameliorative measures as a condition to avoid revocation or suspension, or require corrective measures and suspend the permit. When determining the appropriate sanction, the commission must consider whether:\n(1) the violation results in any significant additional adverse environmental effects;\n(2) the results of the violation can be corrected or ameliorated; and\n(3) suspending or revoking a permit impairs the permittee's electrical power system reliability.",
