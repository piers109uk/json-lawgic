	"text": "The council must maintain a framework that will enable long-range strategic planning and coordination to occur, to the extent possible, across all forested regions of the state and across all ownerships. The framework must include:\n(1) identification of the landscapes within which long-range strategic planning of forest resources can occur, provided that the landscapes must be delineated based on broadly defined ecological units and existing classification systems, yet recognize existing political and administrative boundaries and planning processes;\n(2) a statement of principles and goals for landscape-based forest resource planning; and\n(3) identification of a general process by which landscape-based forest resource planning occurs, provided that the process must give considerable latitude to design planning processes that fit the unique needs and resources of each landscape; reflect a balanced consideration of the economic, social, and environmental conditions and needs of each landscape; and interface and establish formats that are compatible with other landscape-based forest resource plans.\nTo foster landscape-based forest resource planning, the council must maintain regional forest resource committees. Each regional committee shall:\n(1) include representative interests in a particular region that are committed to and involved in landscape planning and coordination activities;\n(2) serve as a forum for landowners, managers, and representative interests to discuss landscape forest resource issues;\n(3) implement an open and public process whereby landscape-based strategic planning of forest resources can occur;\n(4) integrate its landscape planning efforts with existing public and private land management planning efforts in the region;\n(5) facilitate landscape coordination between land managers in the region, both public and private;\n(6) identify and facilitate opportunities for public participation in landscape planning and coordination efforts in the region;\n(7) identify sustainable forest resource goals for the landscape and objectives to achieve those goals;\n(8) periodically recommend that the council undertake revisions of the region's landscape plan; and\n(9) provide regional perspectives to the council with respect to council activities.\n[Repealed, 2014 c 289 s 70]\nThe council chair may appoint a chair from the regional committee participants. The council must include in its budget request sufficient resources for each regional committee to carry out its mission as defined in this section.\nBy November 1 of each even-numbered year, each regional committee must report to the council its work activities and accomplishments.",
