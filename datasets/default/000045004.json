	"text": "At the time and place mentioned in the notice, the appraisers shall meet and thence proceed to view the premises, and hear any evidence or proof offered by the parties interested and may adjourn from time to time for the purpose aforesaid. When their view and hearing shall be concluded they shall determine the amount of damages, if any, suffered by each piece or parcel of land affected by the improvement. They shall determine the amount of special benefits, if any, occurring by reason of diversion of water, drainage, or otherwise, to each piece or parcel of land wherever situate and whether contiguous to the improvement or not. If the damages exceed the benefits to any particular piece, the excess shall be awarded as damages. If the benefits exceed the damages to any particular piece, the difference shall be assessed as benefits, but the total assessment for benefits shall not be greater than the aggregate net award of damages added to the estimated cost of construction; and in every case the benefits assessed upon the several parcels shall be in proportion to the actual benefits received, and no assessment upon any particular piece shall exceed the amount of actual special benefits after deducting the damages, if any.",
