	"text": "The commissioner may grant waivers from the requirements of law for the contracting arrangement between a health care purchasing alliance and an accountable provider network in the areas listed in subdivisions 2 to 4. The commissioner may not waive the following state consumer protection and quality assurance laws:\n(1) laws requiring that enrollees be informed of any restrictions, requirements, or limitations on coverage, services, or access to specialists and other providers;\n(2) laws allowing consumers to complain to or appeal to a state regulatory agency if denied benefits or services;\n(3) laws prohibiting gag clauses and other restrictions on communication between a patient and their physician or provider;\n(4) laws allowing consumers to obtain information on provider financial incentives, which may affect treatment;\n(5) laws requiring the submission of information needed to monitor quality of care and enrollee rights, except the submission may be done in a manner approved by the commissioner under subdivision 4;\n(6) laws protecting enrollee privacy and confidentiality of records;\n(7) minimum standards for adequate provider network capacity and geographic access to services;\n(8) laws assuring continuity of care when a patient must change providers;\n(9) laws governing coverage of emergency services;\n(10) laws prohibiting excessive or unreasonable administrative fees or expenses; and\n(11) other laws or rules that are directly related to quality of care, consumer protection, and due process rights.\n(a) The commissioner may waive the requirements of sections 62N.27 to 62N.32, and may substitute capital and surplus requirements that are reduced from the levels required of other risk-bearing entities in order to reflect its reduced risk exposure. If risk is being underwritten, the underwriter cannot have more than 25 percent of the representation on the governing board of the accountable provider network. The reduced requirements must include at least the following levels of capital and surplus: (i) a deposit of $500,000 and (ii) the greater of an estimated 15 percent of gross premium revenues or twice the net retained annual risk up to $750,000 on a single enrollee. Net retained annual risk may be, for example, the lowest annual deductible under a provider stop-loss insurance policy that covers all costs above the deductible. Assets supporting the deposit must meet the standards for deposits referenced in section 62N.32 or be guaranteed by an entity that is approved and can be monitored by the commissioner. Assets supporting the capital must meet the investment guidelines referenced in section 62N.27. Members of a purchasing alliance may assist in meeting the solvency requirements through a subordinated solvency contribution under a contract approved by the commissioner. For the purposes of this subdivision, \"subordinated solvency contribution\" means a contribution to the accountable provider network by a purchasing alliance member that is evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument that allows for repayment of the contribution in the manner provided in a contract approved by the commissioner.\n(b) An accountable provider network may propose a method of reporting income, expenses, claims payments, and other financial information in a manner which adequately demonstrates ongoing compliance with the standards for capital, surplus, and claims reserves agreed to under this waiver.\n(c) An accountable provider network may demonstrate ability to continue to deliver the contracted health care services to the purchasing alliance through arrangements which ensure that, subject to 60 days' notice of intent to discontinue the contracting arrangement, provider participants will continue to meet their obligation to provide health care services to enrollees for a period of 60 days.\nThe accountable provider network, in conjunction with the health care purchasing alliance, may propose alternative methods to present marketing and disclosure information which assure the accountability to consumers who are offered and who receive their services.\nThe accountable provider network may propose an alternative quality assurance program which incorporates effective methods for reviewing and evaluating data related to quality of care and ways to identify and correct quality problems.",
