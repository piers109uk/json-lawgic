	"text": "Charges established for connections to and the use and availability of service from any water or sewer or combined system, if not paid when due, shall, together with any penalties established for nonpayment, become a lien upon the property connected or for which service was made available. On or before July 1 in each year written notice shall be mailed to the owner of any property as to which such charges are then due and unpaid, stating the amount of the charges and any penalty thereon and that unless paid by October 1 thereafter, or unless a hearing is desired on the question whether such amount and penalty is properly due and payable, the same will be certified, extended, and assessed as a tax or special assessment upon the property for collection with and as a part of other taxes in the following year. Any property owner requesting notice shall be notified of the time and place of such hearing, and the county board, or the commission appointed pursuant to section 116A.24 shall then hear all matters presented by the owner and determine the amount and penalty, if any, which is properly due and payable, and shall cause the same to be certified, extended, and assessed as stated in the notice. The county board or the commission may also provide by resolution for discontinuance of water services to any premises in the event of nonpayment of charges for any water or sewer service provided to the premises, upon reasonable notice to the owner and opportunity for hearing upon any claim that the charges are not properly due and payable.",
