	"text": "An appeal from the judgment of the district court may be taken as in other civil cases within 30 days after the actual entry of the judgment. If no appeal is taken, a certified copy of the judgment shall be filed in the office of the auditor. If an appeal is taken, the determination of the court of appeals shall be certified to the district court and judgment entered in accordance with it, and that judgment certified to and filed in the office of the county auditor. In either case, after the certified copy is filed, orders shall be drawn on the county treasury in payment of any judgment in favor of a claimant. Execution may issue out of the district court for the collection of any costs awarded against a claimant. If costs are awarded against a claimant and there is any allowance on the claim in favor of the claimant, the amount of the costs shall be deducted from the allowance. In any case of an appeal, the county may interpose in the district court as a counterclaim any demand which it has against the claimant, and have execution for the collection of any judgment in its favor.",
