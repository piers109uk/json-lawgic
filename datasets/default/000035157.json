	"text": "(a) Subject to subsection (b):\n(1) in each calendar year following the calendar year in which a limited partnership becomes subject to this chapter, the limited partnership must deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual renewal containing the information required by subsection (c); and\n(2) in each calendar year following the calendar year in which there is first on file with the secretary of state a certificate of authority under section 321.0904 pertaining to a foreign limited partnership, the foreign limited partnership must deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual renewal containing the information required by subsection (c).\n(b) A limited partnership's obligation under subsection (a) ends if the limited partnership delivers to the secretary of state for filing a statement of termination under section 321.0203 and the statement becomes effective under section 321.0206. A foreign limited partnership's obligation under subsection (a) ends if the secretary of state issues and files a certificate of revocation under section 321.0906 or if the foreign limited partnership delivers to the secretary of state for filing a notice of cancellation under section 321.0907(a) and that notice takes effect under section 321.0206. If a foreign limited partnership's obligations under subsection (a) end and later the secretary of state files, pursuant to section 321.0904, a new certificate of authority pertaining to that foreign limited partnership, subsection (a)(2), again applies to the foreign limited partnership and, for the purposes of subsection (a)(2), the calendar year of the new filing is treated as the calendar year in which a certificate of authority is first on file with the secretary of state.\n(c) The annual renewal must contain the items required by section 5.34.\n(d) The secretary of state shall:\n(1) administratively dissolve under section 321.0809 a limited partnership that has failed to file a renewal pursuant to subsection (a); and\n(2) revoke under section 321.0906 the certificate of authority of a foreign limited partnership that has failed to file a renewal pursuant to subsection (a).",
