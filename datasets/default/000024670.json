	"text": "(a) The attorney general, a county attorney, any individual aggrieved by a violation of this act, any entity whose membership includes individuals aggrieved by a violation of this act, any entity whose mission would be frustrated by a violation of this act, or any entity that would expend resources in order to fulfill its mission as a result of a violation of this act, may file an action in the district court for the county where the challenged act or practice has occurred, or in the district court of Ramsey County. Actions brought under this act are subject to expedited pretrial and trial proceedings and must receive an automatic calendar preference. The state is a necessary party in any action in which an alleged violation is based on a political subdivision's implementation of a state law, if the state law does not afford discretion to the political subdivision in its implementation of the law.\n(b) In an action related to a districting or redistricting plan, any individual with standing to challenge any single district shall be deemed to have standing to challenge the districting or redistricting plan as a whole.\nIn any action seeking a temporary injunction or other preliminary relief under this act before an election, the court shall grant relief if warranted based on the factors considered in seeking a temporary injunction or preliminary relief under Minnesota law, except that if the court determines that it is possible to implement appropriate relief that would address an alleged violation before an election, such relief shall not be denied on the basis that the election is close in time or that the relief could result in voter confusion.",
