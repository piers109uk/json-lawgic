	"text": "Clients or relatives aggrieved by an order of the executive board under sections 246.50 to 246.55 may appeal from the order to the district court of the county in which they reside by serving notice of the appeal on the executive board and filing the notice, with proof of service, in the office of the court administrator of the district court within 30 days from the date the order was mailed, or a later date not exceeding one year from the date of mailing as permitted by order of the court. The appeal may be brought on for hearing by the appellant or the executive board upon ten days' written notice. The court must issue an order following an evidentiary hearing affirming or modifying the order of the executive board. When any order or determination of the executive board made under sections 246.50 to 246.55 is brought in question on appeal, the order or determination must be determined de novo. Appeal from the order of the district court may be taken as in other civil cases.",
