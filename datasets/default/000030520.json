	"text": "(a) Unless section 259.13 applies, a person who has resided in this state for at least six months and obtained the person's most recent final marriage dissolution from a district court may apply to the district court in the county where the person resides to change the person's name to the legal name on the person's birth certificate. A person applying for a name change must submit a certified copy of the certificate of dissolution issued pursuant to section 518.148 and a certified copy of the person's birth certificate. A person applying for a name change who obtained a divorce in a state other than Minnesota must submit a certified copy of the certificate of dissolution or a certified copy of an equivalent court order ending the marriage and a certified copy of the person's birth certificate.\n(b) A court shall not require a person applying for a name change to pay filing fees for an application submitted pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding section 259.10, a court shall not require the person applying for a name change pursuant to this section to provide proof of the person's identity by two witnesses unless the proof of identity is necessary to determine whether the person has an intent to defraud or mislead the court.\n(c) Upon meeting the requirements of this section, the court shall grant the application for a name change unless the court finds that: (1) the person has an intent to defraud or mislead the court; or (2) the name change is subject to section 259.13. The court shall notify the person applying for a name change that using a different surname without complying with section 259.13, if applicable, is a gross misdemeanor.",
