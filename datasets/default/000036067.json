	"text": "For purposes of this section:\n(a) \"Brand\" is any word, name, group of letters, symbol, or combination thereof, that is adopted and used by a brewer or importer to identify a specific beer product, and to distinguish that beer product from another beer product.\n(b) \"Brand extension\" is any brand that (1) incorporates all or a substantial part of the unique features of a preexisting brand of the same brewer or importer, and (2) which relies to a significant extent on the goodwill associated with that preexisting brand.\nA brewer or importer who assigns a brand extension to a wholesaler must assign the brand extension to the wholesaler to whom the brewer or importer granted the exclusive sales territory to the brand from which the brand extension resulted. This requirement does not apply to assignments of brand extensions to wholesalers that were made by a brewer or importer before May 6, 1994.\nIn the event that prior to May 6, 1994, a brewer or importer had assigned a brand extension to a wholesaler who was not the appointed wholesaler for the brand from which the brand extension was made, then any additional brand extension must be assigned to the wholesaler who first had the brand.",
