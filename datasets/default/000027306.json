In awarding grants, the commission shall give priority to proposals from multiple applicants. To the extent possible, over time, the commission shall disperse grants equally among the state's congressional districts.\nEach grant for soccer field development under this section must be matched by recipient communities or institutions in accordance with this subdivision. A matching contribution may include an in-kind contribution of land; access roadways and access roadway improvements; and necessary utility services, landscaping, and parking. The first $20,000 of a grant must be matched equally by the recipient. The portion of a grant that is more than $20,000 but not more than $75,000 must be matched by the recipient at a rate double the amount of that portion of the grant. The portion of a grant that is more than $75,000 must be matched by the recipient at a rate of three times the amount of that portion of the grant.",
