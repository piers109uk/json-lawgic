In one copy of the edition, the revisor shall attach a certificate certifying that this comparison has been made and that all sections appear to be correctly printed. The copy containing the revisor's certificate must be filed in the office of the secretary of state as a public record. All other copies of the edition must contain a printed copy of the certificate.\nThe revisor's office shall compose, print, and deliver pamphlets containing parts of Minnesota Statutes, parts of Minnesota Rules, or combinations of parts of the statutes and rules as may be necessary for the use of public officers and departments. The revisor's office shall use a standard form for the pamphlets. The cost of composition, printing, and delivery of the pamphlets, together with a reasonable fee for the revisor's services, is to be borne by the office or department requesting them. The printing must be limited to actual needs as shown by experience or other competent proof. Revenue from the revisor's fee must be deposited in the general fund.\nIn the time before Laws of Minnesota is published each year, the revisor's office shall furnish, upon request and without charge, a copy of each law or resolution to a member of the legislature, a legislative staff member, a constitutional officer, a justice of the supreme court, or a judge of the court of appeals.",
