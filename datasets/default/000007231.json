Provided further, however, that the policy may provide that all or any portion of any indemnities provided by any such policy on account of hospital, nursing, medical or surgical services may, at the insurer's option, be paid directly to the hospital or person rendering such services; but the policy may not require that the services be rendered by a particular hospital or person. Payment so made shall discharge the insurer's obligation with respect to the amount of insurance so paid.\nNothing contained in this section shall be deemed to affect the legal liability of policyholders for the death of, or injury to, any such member of such group.",
