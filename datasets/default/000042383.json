	"text": "Whenever it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the county board that any section post or quarter-section post or other monuments originally fixed and established by the United States in its surveys of the public lands to mark section, quarter-sections and meandered corners have been destroyed or are becoming obscure, the county board may employ a competent surveyor or may direct the county surveyor to relocate and reestablish the same. Such surveyor shall mark each corner reestablished by a sufficient iron or stone landmark and make full and accurate notes and data from which the entire survey can be located, and shall file a certified copy of the same and a map of the same in the office of the county recorder. Such landmarks shall be prima facie evidence that the points where they are located are the section, quarter-section or meandered corners, as the case may be, established by the original United States survey. Before said county board shall employ a surveyor, or direct the county surveyor to relocate and reestablish any such section, quarter-section or meandered corner, the party applying to said board to have the said work done under the direction of said board shall execute and file with the county auditor of said county a good and sufficient bond or undertaking, with sufficient sureties to be approved by the county board, conditioned to pay to said county forthwith on the completion of said survey and the making of full and accurate notes and data from which the entire survey can be relocated, and the filing of a certified copy thereof and the map of said survey in the office of the county recorder, the cost of making the said survey and plat thereof as fixed by said board, and no county board shall order any such survey to be made until such bond or undertaking shall be so filed.",
