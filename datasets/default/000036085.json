	"text": "If a brewer engages in conduct prohibited under sections 325B.01 to 325B.17, a wholesaler may maintain a suit against the brewer in federal or state court in Minnesota. Such a venue may not be waived except at the time that the lawsuit is filed. The court may grant equitable relief as is necessary to remedy the effects of conduct which it finds to exist and which is prohibited under sections 325B.01 to 325B.17, including, but not limited to, declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. The court may, if it finds that the brewer has acted in bad faith in invoking the amendment, termination, cancellation or nonrenewal provisions of sections 325B.01 to 325B.17, or has unreasonably withheld its consent to any assignment, transfer or sale of the wholesaler's agreement, award punitive damages, as well as actual damages, costs and attorneys fees.",
