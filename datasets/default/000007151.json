	"text": "No cooperative or assessment life insurance company shall hereafter issue any policy in this state which does not provide for the payment of a fixed minimum sum, which may be increased each year the insurance remains in force, in the amounts to be provided in the policy. Any agreement or bylaw providing for the placing of a lien upon such policy, except for nonpayment of premium or assessment, and any agreement or bylaw providing for the payment of a less sum than the minimum sum specified in the contract, because of the failure of the corporation to receive or collect the amount in the contract by assessment upon the surviving members, shall be void. Nothing in this section contained shall be so construed as to render any member liable for more than one assessment for each death occurring during the period of membership, unless otherwise specified in the policy. All policies issued by the company shall contain a title including the word \"assessment\" on the face and on the back of the policy correctly describing the same.\nThis section shall not apply to any existing domestic company until it has been in existence for four years.",
