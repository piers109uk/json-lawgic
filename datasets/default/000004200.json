	"text": "Whenever the commissioner finds after investigation that the distribution in the state of Minnesota of any class of food may, by reason of contamination with microorganisms during manufacture, processing, or packing thereof in any locality, be injurious to health, and that such injurious nature cannot be adequately determined after such articles have entered commerce, the commissioner then, and in such case only, shall promulgate rules providing for the issuance, to manufacturers, processors, or packers of such class of food in such locality, of permits to which shall be attached such conditions governing the manufacture, processing, or packaging, or packing of such class of food, for such temporary period of time as may be necessary to protect the public health; and after the effective date of such rules, and during such temporary period, no person shall introduce or deliver for introduction into commerce any such food manufactured, processed, or packed by any such manufacturer, processor, or packer unless such manufacturer, processor, or packer holds a permit issued by the commissioner as provided by such rules.\nThe commissioner is authorized to suspend immediately upon notice any permit issued under authority of this section if it is found that any of the conditions of the permit have been violated. The holder of a permit so suspended may at any time apply for the reinstatement of such permit, and the commissioner shall, immediately after prompt hearing and inspection of the establishment, reinstate such permit or issue an amended permit if it is found that adequate measures have been taken to comply with and maintain the conditions of the permit, as originally issued, or as amended.\nAny officer or employee duly designated by the commissioner shall have access to any factory or establishment, the operator of which holds a permit from the commissioner, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the conditions of the permit are being complied with, and denial of access for such inspection shall be ground for suspension of the permit until such access is freely given by the operator.",
