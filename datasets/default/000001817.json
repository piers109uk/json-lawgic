	"text": "The publication or citation of a rule or order in the State Register in a manner as required by sections 14.001 to 14.69 raises a rebuttable presumption that:\n(1) the rule or order was duly adopted, issued, or promulgated;\n(2) the rule or order was duly filed with the secretary of state and available for public inspection at the day and hour endorsed thereon; and\n(3) the copy of the rule or order published in the State Register is a true copy of the original.\nJudicial notice shall be taken of material published in the State Register.\nThe text of the rules in the first compilation published by the revisor is prima facie evidence of the text of the rules as against any previous documents. However, the previous documents may be used to construe the text of a rule. Except as provided in section 14.47, subdivision 6, the compilation shall not be construed as repealing any unpublished rule. The rules published in the compilation shall be construed as continuations of prior rules and not as new rules.\nAny subsequent compilation or supplement published by the revisor and containing the revisor's certificate is prima facie evidence of the administrative rules in all courts and proceedings. Except as provided in section 14.47, subdivision 6, a compilation or supplement shall not be construed as repealing an unpublished rule. If there is any material inconsistency through omission or otherwise between the first compilation, a subsequent compilation or supplement, the State Register, and a rule filed with the secretary of state, and the omission or change was not due to the provisions of section 14.47, subdivision 6 or the correction of an obvious error or unintentional omission as required by section 14.47, subdivision 3, the rule filed with the secretary shall prevail.",
