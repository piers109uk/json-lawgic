	"text": "(a) For the purposes of this section, the terms in this subdivision have the meanings given.\n(b) \"Other person\" means an immediate family member or someone who personally knows the client and has reason to believe the client is capable of and will carry out a serious, specific threat of harm to a specific, clearly identified or identifiable victim.\n(c) \"Reasonable efforts\" means communicating a serious, specific threat to the potential victim and, if unable to make contact with the potential victim, communicating the serious, specific threat to the law enforcement agency closest to the potential victim or the client.\n(d) \"Licensee\" has the meaning given in section 148.9981 and includes behavior analysis students, interns, and unlicensed supervisees who are participating in a behavior analysis practicum or enrolled in an accredited school or educational program.\nThe duty to predict, warn of, or take reasonable precautions to provide protection from violent behavior arises only when a client or other person has communicated to the licensee a specific, serious threat of physical violence against a specific, clearly identified or identifiable potential victim. If a duty to warn arises, the duty is discharged by the licensee if reasonable efforts are made to communicate the threat.\nIf no duty to warn exists under subdivision 2, then no monetary liability and no cause of action may arise against a licensee for failure to predict, warn of, or take reasonable precautions to provide protection from a client's violent behavior.\nGood faith compliance with the duty to warn must not constitute a breach of confidence and must not result in monetary liability or a cause of action against the licensee.\nSubdivision 2 must not be construed to authorize a licensee to terminate treatment of a client as a direct result of a client's violent behavior or threat of physical violence unless the client is referred to another practitioner or appropriate health care facility.\nThis section does not apply to a threat to commit suicide or other threats by a client to harm the client, or to a threat by a client who is adjudicated as a person who has a mental illness and is dangerous to the public under chapter 253B.\nThis section must not be construed to prohibit a licensee from disclosing confidences to third parties in a good faith effort to warn or take precautions against a client's violent behavior or threat to commit suicide for which a duty to warn does not arise.\nNo monetary liability and no cause of action or disciplinary action by the board may arise against a licensee for disclosure of confidences to third parties, for failure to disclose confidences to third parties, or for erroneous disclosure of confidences to third parties in a good faith effort to warn against or take precautions against a client's violent behavior or threat of suicide for which a duty to warn does not arise.",
