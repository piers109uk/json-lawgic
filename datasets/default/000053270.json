	"text": "(a) The board may refuse to issue, refuse to renew, refuse to reinstate, suspend, revoke eligibility for licensure, or revoke a peace officer or part-time peace officer license for any of the following causes:\n(1) fraud or misrepresentation in obtaining a license;\n(2) failure to meet licensure requirements;\n(3) a violation of section 626.8436, subdivision 1; or\n(4) a violation of the standards of conduct set forth in Minnesota Rules, chapter 6700.\n(b) Unless otherwise provided by the board, a revocation or suspension applies to each license, renewal, or reinstatement privilege held by the individual at the time final action is taken by the board. A person whose license or renewal privilege has been suspended or revoked shall be ineligible to be issued any other license by the board during the pendency of the suspension or revocation.\nThe board may suspend or revoke a peace officer or part-time peace officer license when the licensee has been convicted of a crime recognized by the board as a crime that would disqualify the licensee from participating in a professional peace officer education course, taking the peace officer licensing examination or the part-time peace officer licensing examination, or maintaining eligibility for licensure under Minnesota Rules, chapter 6700. The authority to suspend or revoke a license shall include all individuals who have been granted a license when a disqualifying conviction that would have precluded eligibility for licensure is discovered after licensure.",
