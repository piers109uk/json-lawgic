	"text": "The trustees may repair and alter churches, make rules and orders for managing the temporal affairs of the church, congregation, or society, and dispose of money belonging to it. They may regulate the renting of pews or slips, and the breaking of ground in their cemeteries. Under the direction or approval of the congregation or society, they may erect, acquire, and operate churches, dwellings for their ministers, and other buildings for the use of the church, congregation, or society, hospitals, nurses' homes and training schools, missions, camps and recreational grounds, and other buildings or facilities for other religious, moral, and charitable activities. They may appoint a clerk and treasurer of their board and a collector, regulate their compensation, and remove them at pleasure. The clerk shall enter rules and orders made by the trustees, and payments ordered by them, in a book kept for that purpose.\nThe trustees may not fix the salary of a minister; it must be fixed by a majority of the society entitled to vote at the election of trustees.\nSections 315.03 to 315.05 apply to religious corporations formed under Revised Statutes of the Territory of Minnesota 1851, chapter 36, as amended.",
