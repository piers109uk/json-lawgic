	"text": "In the course of litigation under section 611A.81, any transaction about which a plaintiff testifies or produces evidence does not subject the plaintiff to criminal prosecution or any penalty or forfeiture. Any testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, or information directly or indirectly derived from that testimony or evidence that is given or produced by a plaintiff or a witness for a plaintiff may not be used against that person in any other investigation or proceeding, other than a criminal investigation or proceeding for perjury committed while giving the testimony or producing the evidence.\nEvidence of convictions for prostitution or prostitution-related offenses is inadmissible in a proceeding brought under section 611A.81 for purposes of attacking the plaintiff's credibility. If the court admits evidence of prior convictions for purposes permitted under Minnesota Rules of Evidence, rule 404(b) with respect to motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, the fact finder may consider the evidence solely for those purposes and shall disregard details offered to prove any fact that is not relevant.",
