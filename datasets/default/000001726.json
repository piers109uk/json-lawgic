	"text": "It is the policy of the legislature to encourage state agencies to solicit and receive advice from members of the public. This advice can best be rendered by an advisory task force of a reasonable number of persons working for a limited duration on a specific and clearly defined subject. By this section it is the intent of the legislature to provide for a common nomenclature scheme, facilitate the gathering of advice, and limit the proliferation of costly, unnecessary or outmoded advisory agencies.\nA commissioner of a state department, a state board or other agency having the powers of a board as defined in section 15.012, may create advisory task forces to advise the commissioner or agency on specific programs or topics within the jurisdiction of the department or agency. A task force so created shall have no more than 15 members. The task force shall expire and the terms and removal of members shall be as provided in section 15.059, subdivision 6. The members of no more than four task forces created pursuant to this section in a department or agency may be paid expenses in the same manner and amount as authorized by the commissioner's plan adopted according to section 43A.18, subdivision 2. Task forces mandated by court order must not be counted for purposes of the limit on the number of task forces whose members may be paid expenses. No member of a task force shall be compensated for services in a manner not provided for in statute. A commissioner, board, council, committee, or other state agency may not create any other multimember agency unless specifically authorized by statute or unless the creation of the agency is authorized by federal law as a condition precedent to the receipt of federal money.\n[Repealed, 1Sp2003 c 9 art 10 s 14]",
