	"text": "A water trail is created along the Lake Superior shoreline from Park Point in Duluth to the border with Canada. The trail must be primarily developed for kayakers and campers, using existing public lands for designated rest areas.\nThe commissioner of natural resources must coordinate the creation of the water trail by placing signs for rest areas along the lake and working with other public agencies and private resorts owning land along the lake to do the same. At the earliest opportunity, the commissioner shall make available a water trail map depicting the designated rest areas for the touring public.\nThe commissioner of natural resources is authorized to accept donations of land, or easements in land, for rest areas along the Lake Superior water trail, and may seek and accept money for this purpose from other public and private sources.",
