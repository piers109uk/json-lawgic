	"text": "(a) When a child with a disability exits a district and enters a new district, the child's new district may purchase any assistive technology devices that the child's former district has purchased on the child's behalf. The child's new district must notify, in writing, the child's former district of the intent to purchase the device. The child's new district must complete a purchase agreement according to section 125A.36. The child's former district must respond, in writing, to the request to purchase within 30 days.\n(b) Districts may decline to sell a device if they can demonstrate the technology is a general use device or can be modified for use by other students.\nThe child's former district is not liable for any nonconformities in the equipment after it is purchased by the child's new district, or for injuries arising out of the use of the assistive technology device. This section does not foreclose the child's right to bring suit against the manufacturer, assistive device lessor, or assistive device dealer for nonconformities in or injuries arising out of the use of the assistive technology device.\nNothing contained in this section may be construed as decreasing the obligation of an insurance company or other third-party payor to provide coverage for assistive technology.",
