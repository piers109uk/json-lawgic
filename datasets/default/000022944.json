The governing body of any such city, county, or school district may by resolution establish a commuter van revolving fund to be used to acquire or lease commuter vans for the use of its employees. Any payments out of the fund shall be repaid to the fund out of revenues derived from the use by the employees of the city, county, or school district, of the vans so purchased or leased. Any city, county, or school district which establishes a commuter van acquisition program or contracts for this service is authorized to levy a tax annually on all taxable property in the subdivision for the purpose of establishing a commuter van revolving fund and of paying the administrative and promotional costs of the program, which levy may be in excess of all charter taxing limitations. The governing body of any city, county, or school district may by resolution terminate the commuter van revolving fund and use the funds for other purposes authorized by law.",
