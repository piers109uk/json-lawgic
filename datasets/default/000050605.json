	"text": "The execution shall be under the seal of the court, subscribed by the court administrator, directed to the sheriff, or to the coroner if the sheriff be a party or interested, or to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney, if issued under chapter 551, and endorsed by the party applying therefor or the party's attorney. It shall refer intelligibly to the judgment, stating the court, the county where the judgment roll or transcript is filed, the names of the parties, the amount of the judgment, if it be for money, the amount actually due thereon, together with accrued interest to the date of issuance and the amount of daily interest accruing during the calendar year, and the time of docketing in the county to which the execution is issued. When issued to the sheriff or coroner, it shall require the officer substantially as follows:\n(1) if it be against the property of the judgment debtor, to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of the debtor's personal property, and, if sufficient personal property cannot be found, out of the real property belonging to the debtor on the day when the judgment was docketed in the county, or at any time thereafter not exceeding ten years;\n(2) if real property has been attached, and judgment rendered in favor of the plaintiff in the same action, the execution thereon may also direct a sale of all the property which the defendant had in such real estate at the time it was so attached, or at any time after entry of judgment not exceeding ten years; in such case, if after the attachment the judgment creditor has paid taxes on the real property and filed with the court administrator the tax receipt, it shall be attached to the judgment roll, and the execution shall also state that it has been filed, and the date and amount thereof, and the date of filing; and, if the property be sold under the execution, the proceeds, after deducting the expenses of sale, shall be first applied to the payment of the amount so paid for taxes, with interest;\n(3) if it be against real or personal property in the hands of personal representatives, heirs, devisees, legatees, trustees, or tenants of real property, it shall require the officer to satisfy the judgment, with interest, out of such property;\n(4) if it be against defendants jointly indebted on a contract, a part of whom only have been summoned in the action, it shall issue in form against all; but the party causing it to be issued, or the party's attorney, shall endorse thereon the names of those defendants who have not been summoned, and it shall not be levied upon the sole property of any such defendant; but it may be levied upon the personal property owned by such defendant as a partner with any or all of the other defendants;\n(5) if it be for delivery of the possession of real or personal property, it shall require the officer to deliver possession of the same, particularly describing it, to the party entitled thereto; and it may, at the same time, require the officer to satisfy, out of the personal property of the party against whom the judgment was rendered, any costs, charges, damages, rents, or profits recovered thereby, and the value of the property for which the judgment was recovered, to be specified therein, if a delivery thereof cannot be had; and if sufficient personal property cannot be found, then out of the real property, as provided in clause (1), and in that respect it shall be deemed an execution against property.",
