	"text": "Every policy of insurance against damage by hail issued by any company, however organized, must provide as follows: \"In case of loss under this policy, and failure of the parties to agree as to the amount of the loss, it is mutually agreed that, on written demand of either party, the company and the insured each shall select a competent appraiser and notify the other of the appraiser selected within ten days of the demand. The appraisers shall first select a competent and disinterested umpire; and, failing for ten days to agree upon the umpire, then, on request of either appraiser, the umpire shall be selected by a judge of a court of record in the state in which the property covered is located. By mutual agreement the two appraisers may agree to have the umpire selected by a judge of a court of record and waive the ten-day provision.\nThe appraisers and the umpire shall then appraise the loss. A written award of any two of these persons determines the amount of loss. The written award of a majority of these referees is final and conclusive upon the parties as to amount of loss, and this selection, unless waived by the parties, is a condition precedent to any right of action to recover for a loss. No suit for the recovery of any claim by virtue of this policy may be sustained unless commenced within one year after the loss occurred.\" The policy must also provide the form, manner, and length of notice to be given to the company by the insured of any loss sustained.",
