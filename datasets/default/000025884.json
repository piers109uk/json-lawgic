	"text": "Except as provided in subdivision 2, if a candidate is found guilty of violating this chapter or section 609.771 or an offense was committed by another individual with the knowledge, consent, or connivance of the candidate, the court, after entering the adjudication of guilty, shall enter a supplemental judgment declaring that the candidate has forfeited the nomination or office. If the court enters the supplemental judgment, it shall transmit to the filing officer a transcript of the supplemental judgment, the nomination or office becomes vacant, and the vacancy must be filled as provided by law.\nIn a trial for a violation of this chapter, the candidate's nomination or election is not void if the court finds that:\n(1) an offense, though committed by the candidate or with the candidate's knowledge, consent, or connivance, was trivial; or\n(2) an act or omission of a candidate arose from accidental miscalculation or other reasonable cause, but in any case not from a want of good faith;\nand the court also finds that it would be unjust for a candidate to forfeit the nomination or election.\nNone of these findings is a defense to a conviction under this chapter.",
