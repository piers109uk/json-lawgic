	"text": "A majority of the members of the board of managers may initiate a project by a resolution finding that the project generally conforms with the watershed management plan of the watershed district. The resolution must:\n(1) identify the project by name and number;\n(2) identify intended sources of project funding; and\n(3) designate an engineer to make surveys, maps, and a report on the proposed project.\n(a) A project initiated under this section may be funded from one or more sources of funds available to the watershed district, including but not limited to levy, assessment, a water management district charge, and external sources. The availability and use of a source of funding must be as specified in applicable law.\n(b) The finding under subdivision 1 as to intended sources of funding is not binding on the managers. However, the procedures of this chapter must be afforded to property owners affected by any subsequent decision of the managers to expand the use of assessment.\nProcedures in section 103D.715 for appointing resident appraisers and determining benefits apply to a project initiated by resolution of the managers only if and to the extent that a project is to be funded in whole or part by assessment.",
