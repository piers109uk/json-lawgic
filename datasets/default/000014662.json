The local government must notify each owner of property that may be acquired in writing by certified mail of the public hearing on the proposed taking, post the public hearing information on the local government's website, if any, and publish notice of the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the local government's jurisdiction. Notice must be provided at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the hearing.\n(b) Any interested person must be allowed reasonable time to present relevant testimony at the public hearing. The proceedings of the hearing must be recorded and available to the public for review and comment at reasonable times and a reasonable place. At the next regular meeting of the local government that is at least 30 days after the public hearing, the local government must vote on the question of whether to authorize the local government or local government agency to use eminent domain to acquire the property.\nIf the taking is for the mitigation of a blighted area, remediation of an environmentally contaminated area, reducing abandoned property, or removing a public nuisance, then the resolution of a local government or local government agency authorizing the use of eminent domain must:\n(1) identify and describe the public costs and benefits that are known or expected to result from the program or project for which the property interest is proposed to be acquired; and\n(2) address how the acquisition of the property interest serves one or more identified public uses or public purposes and why the acquisition of the property is needed to accomplish those public uses or public purposes.",
