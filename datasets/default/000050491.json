In any such action brought by the occupant against a claimant to quiet title or to determine any adverse claim, the claimant, in the answer in addition to setting up the claimant's title, may allege the value of the premises without improvements at the commencement of the action, and also the value of the yearly rent of the land without improvements during the possession of the occupant; and the occupant may, in addition to other proper matters of reply, allege the amount and value of all improvements made, and the amount of all taxes and assessments paid by the occupant or those under whom the occupant claims, and, if the claim be under an official deed, the purchase money paid therefor. In case the title be found to be in the claimant, the jury, or, if the case be tried without a jury, the court, shall assess the value of all improvements made and taxes and assessments paid upon the land by the occupant, or those under whom the occupant claims, with interest at six percent, and, if the occupant claims under an official deed, regular upon its face, and without actual notice of any defect invalidating it, shall also find the purchase money paid by the occupant, or those under whom the occupant claims, with interest at six percent; and the jury or court shall also assess the value of the land at the commencement of the action, without improvements, and also the value of the yearly rent thereof during the occupant's possession. If the land has depreciated in value since its purchase at an official sale, the jury or court may allow such part only of the purchase money as, in their discretion, they may see fit.",
