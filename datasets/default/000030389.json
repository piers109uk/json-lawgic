	"text": "(a) The commissioner shall adjust the rates of a nursing facility that meets the criteria for the special dietary needs of its residents and the requirements in section 31.651 or 31.658. The adjustment for raw food cost shall be the difference between the nursing facility's most recently reported allowable raw food cost per resident day and 115 percent of the median allowable raw food cost per resident day. This amount shall be removed from other care-related costs per resident day as determined in section 256R.23, subdivision 3, and included in the external fixed costs payment rate under section 256R.25.\n(b) In calculating a nursing facility's other care-related costs per day for the purposes of comparing to an array, a median, or other statistical measure of nursing facility payment rates used to determine future rate adjustments under this chapter, the commissioner shall exclude adjustments for raw food costs under this section.",
