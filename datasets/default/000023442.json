	"text": "(a) A TNC must provide a driver with the option to opt out of arbitration. Upon a driver's written election to pursue remedies through arbitration, the driver must not seek remedies through district court based on the same alleged violation.\n(b) The rights and remedies established in this chapter must be the governing law in an arbitration between a driver operating in Minnesota and a TNC. The application of the rights and remedies available under chapter 181C cannot be waived by a driver prior to or at the initiation of an arbitration between a driver and a TNC. To the extent possible, a TNC shall use Minnesota as the venue for arbitration with a Minnesota driver. If an arbitration cannot take place in the state of Minnesota, the driver must be allowed to appear via phone or other electronic means and apply the rights and remedies available under chapter 181C. Arbitrators must be jointly selected by the TNC and the driver using the roster of qualified neutrals provided by the Minnesota supreme court for alternative dispute resolution. Consistent with the rules and guidelines provided by the American Arbitrators Association, if the parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator through the joint selection process, the case manager may administratively appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators.\n(c) Contracts that have already been executed must have an addendum provided to each driver that includes a copy of this chapter and notice that a driver may elect to pursue the remedies provided in this chapter.",
