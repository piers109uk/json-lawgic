	"text": "(a) The expiration of a period of limitation on the owner's right to receive or recover property, whether specified by contract, statute, or court order, does not preclude the property from being presumed abandoned or affect a duty to file a report or to pay or deliver or transfer property to the administrator as required by sections 345.31 to 345.60. This paragraph applies to any expiration of a period of limitations that occurs whether before or after the effective date of sections 345.31 to 345.60.\n(b) An action or proceeding may not be maintained by the administrator to enforce sections 345.31 to 345.60 in regard to the reporting, delivery, or payment of property more than ten years after the holder specifically identified the property in a report filed with the administrator or gave express notice to the administrator of a dispute regarding the property. In the absence of such a report or other express notice, the period of limitation is tolled. The period of limitation is also tolled by the filing of a report that is fraudulent.",
