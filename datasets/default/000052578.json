	"text": "If, after an order of abatement has been entered, the owner appears and pays the costs of the action and files a bond in an amount determined by the court, but not to exceed $50,000, conditioned that the owner will immediately abate the nuisance for a period of one year, the court may, if satisfied of the owner's good faith, order the release of the building or portion of it which is subject to the order of abatement. If the premises are released, for each day during the term of the bond that the owner knowingly permits any part of the premises to be used for any activity which was the basis of the abatement order, the owner shall forfeit $1,000 under the bond. Forfeiture under the bond does not relieve the owner from prosecution for contempt. Release of the property pursuant to this section does not release it from an injunction issued under section 617.83 or any other judgment, penalty, lien, or liability to which it may be subject by law.",
