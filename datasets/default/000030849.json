	"text": "If a child is taken into custody as provided in section 260C.175, the parent, guardian, or custodian of the child shall be notified as soon as possible. Unless there is reason to believe that the child would endanger self or others or not return for a court hearing, or that the child's health or welfare would be immediately endangered, the child shall be released to the custody of a parent, guardian, or other suitable relative. When a child is taken into custody by a peace officer under section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (2), item (ii), release from detention may be authorized by the detaining officer, the detaining officer's supervisor, the county attorney, or the social services agency, provided that the agency has conducted an assessment and with the family has developed and implemented a safety plan for the child, if needed. The person to whom the child is released shall promise to bring the child to the court, if necessary, at the time the court may direct. If the person taking the child into custody believes it desirable, that person may request the parent, guardian, custodian, or other person designated by the court to sign a written promise to bring the child to court as provided above. The intentional violation of such a promise, whether given orally or in writing, shall be punishable as contempt of court.\nThe court may require the parent, guardian, custodian, or other person to whom the child is released, to post any reasonable bail or bond required by the court which shall be forfeited to the court if the child does not appear as directed. The court may also release the child on the child's own promise to appear in juvenile court.\n(a) If the child is not released as provided in subdivision 1, the person taking the child into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the child and the reasons for detention.\n(b) No child taken into custody and placed in a relative's home or shelter care facility by a peace officer pursuant to section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (1) or (2), item (ii), may be held in custody longer than 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, unless a petition has been filed and the judge or referee determines pursuant to section 260C.178 that the child shall remain in custody or unless the court has made a finding of domestic abuse perpetrated by a minor after a hearing under Laws 1997, chapter 239, article 10, sections 2 to 26, in which case the court may extend the period of detention for an additional seven days, within which time the social services agency shall conduct an assessment and shall provide recommendations to the court regarding voluntary services or file a child in need of protection or services petition.\nIf the person who has taken the child into custody determines that the child should be placed in a secure detention facility or a shelter care facility, that person shall advise the child and as soon as is possible, the child's parent, guardian, or custodian:\n(1) of the reasons why the child has been taken into custody and why the child is being placed in a juvenile secure detention facility or a shelter care facility;\n(2) of the location of the juvenile secure detention facility or a shelter care facility. If there is reason to believe that disclosure of the location of the shelter care facility would place the child's health and welfare in immediate endangerment, disclosure of the location of the shelter care facility shall not be made;\n(3) that the child's parent, guardian, or custodian and attorney or guardian ad litem may make an initial visit to the juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility at any time. Subsequent visits by a parent, guardian, or custodian may be made on a reasonable basis during visiting hours and by the child's attorney or guardian ad litem at reasonable hours;\n(4) that the child may telephone parents and an attorney or guardian ad litem from the juvenile secure detention facility or shelter care facility immediately after being admitted to the facility and thereafter on a reasonable basis to be determined by the director of the facility;\n(5) that the child may not be detained pursuant to section 260C.175, subdivision 1, clause (1) or (2), item (ii), at a shelter care facility longer than 72 hours, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, unless a petition has been filed within that time and the court orders the child's continued detention, pursuant to section 260C.178;\n(6) of the date, time, and place of the detention hearing, if this information is available to the person who has taken the child into custody; and\n(7) that the child and the child's parent, guardian, or custodian have the right to be present and to be represented by counsel at the detention hearing, and that if they cannot afford counsel, counsel will be appointed at public expense for the child, or for any party, if it is a child in need of protection or services, neglected and in foster care, or termination of parental rights matter.\nIf a child is to be detained in a secure detention facility or a shelter care facility, the child shall be promptly transported to the facility in a manner approved by the facility or by securing a written transportation order from the court authorizing transportation by the sheriff or other qualified person. The person who has determined that the child should be detained shall deliver to the court and the supervisor of the secure detention facility or shelter care facility where the child is placed, a signed report, setting forth:\n(1) the time the child was taken into custody;\n(2) the time the child was delivered for transportation to the secure detention facility or shelter care facility;\n(3) the reasons why the child was taken into custody;\n(4) the reasons why the child has been placed in detention;\n(5) a statement that the child and the child's parent have received the notification required by subdivision 3 or the reasons why they have not been so notified; and\n(6) any instructions required by subdivision 5.\nWhen a child is to be placed in a shelter care facility, the person taking the child into custody or the court shall determine whether or not there is reason to believe that disclosure of the shelter care facility's location to the child's parent, guardian, or custodian would immediately endanger the health and welfare of the child.

This determination shall be included in the report required by subdivision 4, along with instructions to the shelter care facility to notify or withhold notification.\n(a) When a child has been delivered to a secure detention facility, the supervisor of the facility shall deliver to the court a signed report acknowledging receipt of the child stating the time of the child's arrival.
