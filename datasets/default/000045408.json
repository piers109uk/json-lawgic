	"text": "Every two years a port authority shall name national or state banks within the state as depositories. Before acting as a depository, a named bank shall give the authority a bond approved as to form and surety by the authority. The bond must be conditioned for the safekeeping and prompt repayment of deposits. The amount of the bond must be at least equal to the maximum sum expected to be on deposit at any one time.\nWhen port authority funds are deposited by the treasurer in a bonded depository, the treasurer and the surety on the treasurer's official bond are exempt from liability for the loss of the deposits because of the failure, bankruptcy, or any other act or default of the depository. A port authority may accept assignments of collateral from its depository to secure deposits in the same manner as assignments of collateral are permitted by law to secure deposits of the port authority's city.",
