Costs may include but are not limited to building operating expenses such as front desk, tenant service coordination, revenue shortfall, and security costs. These funds may be capitalized as part of development costs. Funds may be provided to support existing permanent supportive housing units or to cover costs associated with new permanent supportive housing units.\n(b) Funds may be used to create partnerships with the health care sector and other sectors to demonstrate sustainable ways to provide services for supportive housing residents, improve access to health care, and reduce the use of expensive emergency and institutional care. This may be done in partnership with other state agencies, including the Department of Health and the Department of Human Services.\nThe commissioner shall develop forms and procedures for soliciting and reviewing applications for funding under this section. The commissioner shall consult with interested stakeholders when developing the guidelines and procedures for the program.",
