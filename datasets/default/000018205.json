In the effort to preserve the environmental values of the state, outstanding geographical areas possessing historical, architectural and aesthetic values are of paramount importance in the development of the state; in the face of ever increasing extensions of urban centers, highways, and residential, commercial and industrial developments, areas with an unusual concentration of distinctive historical and architectural values are threatened by destruction or impairment. It is in the public interest to provide a sense of community identity and preserve these historic districts which represent and reflect elements of the state's cultural, social, economic, religious, political, architectural and aesthetic heritage.",
