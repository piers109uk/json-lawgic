	"text": "Notwithstanding any contrary provision of other law, the Board of Commissioners of Hennepin County may insure the county against any claim of liability or loss using funds of the county, without procuring insurance from any private insurance company when the county board considers it to be in the best interests of the county. This provision shall not be construed as an increase of the liability limitations or as a waiver of defenses allowable in any action pursuant to chapter 466. The board may transfer amounts of money from funds of the county to the funds the county may establish for the above purposes in accord with generally accepted accounting principles. The term \"liability\" shall extend to all liability or loss that may be covered by any form of insurance, including but not limited to malpractice, general liability, or workers' compensation. Section 471.617 applies to Hennepin County.\nWhen Hennepin County purchases commercial insurance, the coverage may include a deductible, the amount of which shall be determined by the board of commissioners.",
