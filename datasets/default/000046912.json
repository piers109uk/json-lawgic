	"text": "A trust may be created to provide for the care of an animal alive during the settlor's lifetime. The trust terminates upon the death of the animal or, if the trust was created to provide for the care of more than one animal alive during the settlor's lifetime, upon the death of the last surviving animal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the trust may not be enforced for more than 90 years.\nA trust authorized by this section may be enforced by a person appointed in the terms of the trust or, if no person is appointed, by a person appointed by a court. A person having an interest in the welfare of the animal may request the court to appoint a person to enforce the trust or to remove an appointed person.\nProperty of a trust authorized by this section may be applied only to the trust's intended use, except to the extent a court determines that the value of the trust property exceeds the amount required for the intended use. Upon termination of the trust, or if the court determines the trust has excess funds, the trustee shall transfer the unexpended or excess trust property pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument or, if there is no provision in the trust instrument, then the trust passes to the settlor's heirs-at-law determined as if the settlor died intestate domiciled in this state at the time of distribution.\nMS 2020 [Repealed, 2022 c 98 art 2 s 16]",
