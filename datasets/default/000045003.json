	"text": "The legislature finds that problems of growth and development in urban and rural regions of the state so transcend the boundary lines of local government units that no single unit can plan for their solution without affecting other units in the region; that coordination of multijurisdictional activities is essential to the development and implementation of effective policies and programs; that intergovernmental cooperation is an effective means of pooling the resources of local government to approach common problems; and that the assistance of the state is needed to make the most effective use of local, state, federal, and private programs in serving the citizens of such urban and rural regions.\nIt is the purpose of sections 462.381 to 462.398 to authorize the establishment of regional development commissions to work with and on behalf of local units of government to develop plans or implement programs to address economic, social, physical, and governmental concerns of each region of the state. The commissions may assist with, develop, or implement plans or programs for individual local units of government.",
