	"text": "If the commissioner has assessed a penalty against a party subject to this chapter and the party believes the penalty is not warranted, the party may request that a formal hearing be held on the matter. The request must be filed within 30 days of the date that the penalty assessment is served on the party. Upon receipt of a timely request for a hearing the commissioner shall refer the matter to the chief administrative law judge for assignment to a compensation judge or administrative law judge.\nThe chief administrative law judge shall keep a record of the proceeding and provide a record pursuant to section 176.421.\nThe decision of the compensation judge or administrative law judge shall be final and shall be binding and enforceable. The decision may be appealed to the Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals.\nThis section does not apply to penalties for which another appeal procedure is provided, including but not limited to penalties imposed pursuant to section 176.102 or 176.103.\nFor purposes of this section, a hearing before an administrative law judge shall be treated in the same manner as a hearing before a compensation judge and no costs may be charged to the commissioner for the hearing, regardless of who hears it.",
