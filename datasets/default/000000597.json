Only a party to the contract may bring action against the state.\nNo action shall be maintained unless it is commenced within 90 days after the plaintiff has been furnished by the state with a final estimate under the contract, or, at the election of the plaintiff, within six months after the work provided for under the contract is completed.\nThe action may be brought in the district court in the county where the cause of action or some part of it arose or in the district court in Ramsey County. The action shall be commenced by filing a complaint with the administrator of court and serving a summons and copy of the complaint upon the attorney general at the State Capitol. The state shall have 40 days from the date of the service to serve an answer upon the plaintiff. The action shall proceed in the district court as other actions at law.\nAn appeal from a final order or judgment in the action may be taken as in other civil cases.\nThis section does not apply to controversies arising out of a contract to construct or repair a state trunk highway.",
