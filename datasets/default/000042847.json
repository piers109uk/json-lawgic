This certification is in addition to the three candidates certified under clause (7). This expanded certification may not include a member of a protected group if a member of that group is one of the three candidates certified under clause (7). Certifications under this paragraph must be made from the list of eligible candidates who have successfully completed the examination, in order of their standing in the examination. These expanded certification procedures apply only to positions to be filled from the public and do not apply to promotional appointments.\nCopies of such rules must be kept posted in a conspicuous place at each police station house and no rules of general application with reference to employment, promotion, discharge, or suspension are effective until posted.",
