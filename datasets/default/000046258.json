	"text": "Any real or personal property acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, or occupied by the authority or county for any of the purposes of Laws 2006, chapter 257, is declared to be acquired, owned, leased, controlled, used, and occupied for public, governmental, and municipal purposes, and is exempt from ad valorem taxation by the state or any political subdivision of the state; provided that the properties are subject to special assessments levied by a political subdivision for a local improvement in amounts proportionate to and not exceeding the special benefit received by the properties from the improvement. No possible use of any of the properties in any manner different from their use under Laws 2006, chapter 257, at the time may be considered in determining the special benefit received by the properties. Notwithstanding section 272.01, subdivision 2, or 273.19, real or personal property subject to a lease or use agreement between the authority or county and another person for uses related to the purposes of Laws 2006, chapter 257, including the operation of the ballpark and related parking facilities, is exempt from taxation regardless of the length of the lease or use agreement. This section, insofar as it provides an exemption or special treatment, does not apply to any real property that is leased for residential, business, or commercial development or other purposes different from those contemplated in Laws 2006, chapter 257.",
