A writ is sufficient if the petitioner and the person to whom the writ is directed are designated in it with reasonable certainty, by name, description, or otherwise. Either the petitioner or the person to whom the writ is directed may be designated by an assumed name if the true name is unknown or uncertain. The person served with the writ is considered to be the person to whom it is directed, although the name or description is wrong, or is that of another person.",
