	"text": "(a) Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, the boundaries between adjoining units may be relocated by an amendment to the declaration upon application to the association by the owners of those units. The owners of the adjoining units shall specify the proposed reallocation between their units of their common element interests, votes in the association, and common expense liabilities in the application and in accord with section 515A.2-108. Unless the board of directors determines within 60 days after receipt of the application by the association that the proposed amendment is not in the best interests of the condominium, the unit owners shall prepare an amendment which shall identify the units involved, state the reallocation, be executed by those unit owners and by any holder of an interest as security for an obligation, contain words of conveyance between them, contain written consent of the association, and upon recordation be indexed in the name of the grantor and the grantee. The amendment shall include an amended floor plan or if amended after July 31, 1986, an amended condominium plat, to show the altered boundaries between the adjoining units and their dimensions and identifying numbers. If a holder of an interest as security for an obligation joins in the amendment pursuant to this section, the extent of the interest and the remedies shall be deemed to be modified as provided in the amendment. The association shall incur no liability to any party by reason of performing those acts enumerated in this section.\n(b) The association may require the owners of the affected units to build a boundary wall and other common elements between the units.\n(c) The applicant shall deliver a certified copy of the amendment to the association.",
