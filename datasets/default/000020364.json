	"text": "To be eligible for licensure renewal, a licensee must:\n(1) submit a completed and signed application for licensure renewal;\n(2) submit the renewal fee required under section 148.6445;\n(3) submit proof of having met the continuing education requirement of section 148.6443; and\n(4) submit additional information as requested by the board to clarify information presented in the renewal application. The information must be submitted within 30 calendar days of the board's request.\n(a) Except as provided in paragraph (c), licenses must be renewed every two years. Licensees must comply with the following procedures in paragraphs (b) to (e).\n(b) Each license must state an expiration date. An application for licensure renewal must be received by the board at least 30 calendar days before the expiration date.\n(c) If the board changes the renewal schedule and the expiration date is less than two years, the fee and the continuing education contact hours to be reported at the next renewal must be prorated.\n(d) An application for licensure renewal not received within the time required under paragraph (b), but received on or before the expiration date, must be accompanied by a late fee in addition to the renewal fee specified by section 148.6445.\n(e) Licensure renewals received after the expiration date must comply with the requirements of section 148.6425.\nAt least 60 days before the expiration date in subdivision 2, the board must send or transmit a renewal notice to the licensee. The notice must include information about accessing the license renewal and fee schedule. The licensee's failure to receive notice does not relieve the licensee of the obligation to meet the renewal deadline and other requirements for licensure renewal.\nThe license renewal cycle for occupational therapy licensees is converted to a two-year cycle where renewal is due on the last day of the licensee's month of birth. Conversion pursuant to this section begins January 1, 2021. This section governs license renewal procedures for licensees who were licensed before December 31, 2020. The conversion renewal cycle is the renewal cycle following the first license renewal after January 1, 2020. The conversion license period is the license period for the conversion renewal cycle. The conversion license period is between 13 and 24 months and ends on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in either 2022 or 2023, as described in subdivision 5.\nFor a licensee whose license is current as of December 31, 2020, the licensee's conversion license period begins on January 1, 2021, and ends on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in 2023, except that for licensees whose month of birth is January, February, March, April, May, or June, the licensee's renewal cycle ends on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in 2022.\nThis subdivision applies to a licensee who was licensed before December 31, 2020, but whose license is not current as of December 31, 2020. When the licensee first renews the license after January 1, 2021, the conversion renewal cycle begins on the date the licensee applies for renewal and ends on the last day of the licensee's month of birth in the next year, except that if the last day of the licensee's month of birth is less than six months after the date the licensee applies for renewal, then the renewal period ends on the last day of the licensee's month of birth two years after the date of renewal.\nAfter the licensee's conversion renewal cycle under subdivision 5 or 6, subsequent renewal cycles are biennial and begin on the first day of the month following the licensee's birth month.\n(a) A licensee who holds a license issued before January 1, 2021, and who renews that license pursuant to subdivision 5 or 6, must pay a renewal fee as required in this subdivision.\n(b) A licensee must be charged the biennial license fee listed in section 148.6445 for the conversion license period.\n(c) For a licensee whose conversion license period is 13 to 24 months, the first biennial license fee charged after the conversion license period must be adjusted to credit the excess fee payment made during the conversion license period. The credit is calculated by:\n(1) subtracting the number of months of the licensee's conversion license period from 24; and\n(2) multiplying the result of clause (1) by 1/24 of the biennial fee rounded up to the next dollar.\n(d) For a licensee whose conversion license period is 24 months, the first biennial license fee charged after the conversion license period must not be adjusted.\n(e) For the second and all subsequent license renewals made after the conversion license period, the licensee's biennial license fee is as listed in section 148.6445.\nSubdivisions 4, 5, 7, and 8 expire December 31, 2023.",
