	"text": "Upon the filing of a resolution by the county board of any county with the county auditor, in the case of a public ditch system lying wholly within a county, or with the court administrator of the district court having jurisdiction over said ditch in the case of a ditch system affecting two or more counties, therein setting forth that it would be advantageous or desirable in the construction or maintenance of a highway under the jurisdiction of the county to make a minor alteration or change in a public ditch system directly affecting the highway, and that the alteration or change will not affect the functioning or efficiency of the ditch system, it shall be the duty of the auditor, or the clerk with the approval of the judge, to fix a time and place for hearing thereon and to give notice of hearing by publication as defined by section 103E.005, subdivision 24. Upon the filing of the resolution, the board shall also cause to be filed a plan showing in detail the alteration or change therein described. If upon the hearing it shall appear to the county board or district court that the alteration or change in the public ditch system will not affect or impair the efficiency of the ditch system, the board or court shall make its order authorizing the county to cause the alteration or change to be made. Upon the making of the order by the county board or the court, the county board may proceed at the sole cost and expense of the county to make the alterations or changes as may be in the order allowed; damages, if any, occasioned thereby being first duly paid or secured by the county. Upon completion of the alteration or change, the county board shall cause to be filed with the auditor or court administrator a map and profile drawn to scale showing thereon the change or alteration made. If the map and profile be filed with the court administrator, duplicates thereof shall also be filed with the auditor of each county affected. Upon the completion of the alteration or change herein provided for, the ditch shall thereafter include the alteration or change as part thereof with the same force and effect as though it had been originally so constructed and established.",
