The plan shall state how the company will correct its surplus deficiency. The plan must be submitted within 45 days of the company falling below the minimum surplus level.\nWithin 30 days after the submission by a township mutual fire insurance company of a corrective action plan, the commissioner shall notify the insurer whether the plan may be implemented or is, in the judgment of the commissioner, unsatisfactory. If the commissioner determines the plan is unsatisfactory, the notification to the company must set forth the reasons for the determination, and may set forth proposed revisions that will render the plan satisfactory in the judgment of the commissioner. Upon notification from the commissioner, the insurer shall prepare a revised corrective action plan that may incorporate by reference any revisions proposed by the commissioner, and shall submit the revised plan to the commissioner within 45 days.",
