If emergency rules are not adopted within the time allowed, the authority for the rules expires. The time limit of this section does not include any days used for review by the attorney general. If the 180-day period expires while the attorney general is reviewing the rule and the attorney general disapproves the rule, the commissioner may resubmit the rule to the attorney general after taking corrective action. The resubmission must occur within five working days after the commissioner receives written notice of disapproval. If the rule is again disapproved by the attorney general, it is withdrawn.",
