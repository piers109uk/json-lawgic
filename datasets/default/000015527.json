	"text": "When provisions of sections 123A.64 to 123A.72 are made to apply to any special school district, such district shall hereby be converted to an independent school district on the effective date specified in the orders issued under provisions of sections 123A.64 to 123A.72. All applicable provisions of Minnesota Statutes 1965, section 122.26, relating to such conversions shall otherwise be in force. To the extent that any law or charter provision of any special district is inconsistent with the status of an independent school district or the powers common to independent school districts, such law or charter provision is hereby repealed. Provided, however, that nothing in sections 123A.64 to 123A.72 shall in any way invalidate remaining portions of such laws or home rule charters, or the continuance of such special school districts to which no new territory is attached under the provisions of sections 123A.64 to 123A.72.",
