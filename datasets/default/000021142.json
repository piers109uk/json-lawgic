	"text": "A podiatrist may use an oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture for sedation or analgesia only under the following conditions:\n(1) the patient is not rendered unconscious;\n(2) the nitrous oxide concentration is 70 percent of the mixture or less;\n(3) the oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture is administered only by nasal inhalator equipped with scavenging system;\n(4) an individual other than the attending podiatrist monitors the equipment and the patient during the administration of oxygen-nitrous oxide sedation and is medically directed and supervised by the podiatrist;\n(5) the podiatrist and the individual referred to in clause (4) have successfully completed, after December 31, 1986, a course in nitrous oxide sedation approved by a school of podiatric medicine;\n(6) the podiatrist and the individual referred to in clause (4) have completed, after December 31, 1986, a course in cardiopulmonary resuscitation;\n(7) oxygen-nitrous oxide is not used in conjunction with any other analgesic or sedative; and\n(8) the machine used for administering the oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture includes:\n(i) an automatic shutoff valve in the event the oxygen concentration is less than three liters per minute;\n(ii) an immediately available oxygen flush capability utilizing a positive pressure mask for pure oxygen delivery;\n(iii) an automatic control over maximum nitrous oxide concentration which prevents oxygen concentration from falling below 30 percent of the mixture when nitrous oxide flow is maximal; and\n(iv) color-coded valves, tanks, and knobs, and pin index and diameter index safety systems.",
