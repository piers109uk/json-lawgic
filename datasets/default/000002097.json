These expenses must be awarded against the defendant and are not allowed against the state or a political subdivision. If the prosecuting attorney does not intervene in the action and the person bringing the action conducts the action and the defendant prevails in the action, the court shall award to the defendant reasonable expenses and attorney fees against the person bringing the action if it finds that the action was clearly frivolous or vexatious or brought in substantial part for harassment. The state or a political subdivision is not liable for expenses, attorney fees, or other costs incurred by a person in bringing or defending an action under this chapter.",
