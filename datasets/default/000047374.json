	"text": "If after execution of a trust instrument in which a sole settlor reserves a power to alter, amend, revoke, or terminate the provisions of the trust, the settlor's marriage is dissolved or annulled, the dissolution or annulment revokes any disposition, provision for beneficial enjoyment or appointment of property made by the trust instrument to a settlor's former spouse, any provisions conferring a general or special power of appointment on the former spouse and any appointment of the former spouse as trustee, unless the trust instrument expressly provides otherwise.\nProperty prevented from passing to a former spouse because of revocation by dissolution or annulment of marriage passes as if the former spouse died on the date of the entry of the judgment and decree dissolving or annulling the settlor's marriage and other provisions conferring some power or office on the former spouse are interpreted as if the former spouse died on the date of the entry of the judgment and decree dissolving or annulling the settlor's marriage.\nIf provisions are revoked solely by this section, they are revived by the settlor's remarriage to the former spouse. For purposes of this chapter, dissolution of marriage includes divorce. A decree of separation which does not terminate the status of spouses is not a dissolution of marriage for purposes of this section. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section revokes a trust instrument.",
