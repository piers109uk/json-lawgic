	"text": "Minnesota supplemental aid payments must be issued to the recipient, a protective payee, or a conservator or guardian of the recipient's estate in the form of county warrants immediately redeemable in cash, electronic benefits transfer, or by direct deposit into the recipient's account in a financial institution. Minnesota supplemental aid payments must be issued regularly on the first day of the month. The supplemental aid warrants must be mailed only to the address at which the recipient resides, unless another address has been approved in advance by the county agency. Vendor payments must not be issued by the county agency except for nonrecurring emergency need payments; at the request of the recipient; for special needs, other than special diets; or when the agency determines the need for protective payments exist.",
