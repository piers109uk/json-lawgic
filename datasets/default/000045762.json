If the election is made, the powers and duties set forth in sections 469.090 to 469.108 supersede the special law and the special law must not be used after the election. The use of powers under sections 469.090 to 469.108 by a city described in this section does not impair the security of any obligations issued or contracts or agreements executed under the special law. Control, authority, and operation of any project may be transferred to the authority in the manner provided in section 469.094.",
