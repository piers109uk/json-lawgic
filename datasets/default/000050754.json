When such recovery is had in consequence of irregularity, the judgment creditor shall thereupon be entitled, within ten years after such eviction, to a new execution on the judgment for the price paid on the sale, with interest; and for that purpose the judgment shall be deemed valid against the judgment debtor, the debtor's personal representatives, heirs, or devisees, but not against a purchaser or encumbrancer in good faith who became such before a levy on such new execution.",
