	"text": "If the commissioner of revenue orders a reassessment of all or any portion of the property in a municipality other than in the form of a mathematically prescribed adjustment of valuation, or if omitted property is placed upon the tax rolls, and the reassessment has not been completed or the property placed upon the rolls, as the case may be, by November 15, the net tax capacity of the affected property shall, for purposes of sections 473F.03 to 473F.08, be determined from the abstracts filed by the county auditor with the commissioner of revenue.\nIf the reassessment, when completed and incorporated in the commissioner of revenue's certification of the net tax capacity of the municipality, or the listing of omitted property, when placed on the rolls, results in an increase in the net tax capacity of commercial-industrial property in the municipality which differs from that used, pursuant to subdivision 1, for purposes of sections 473F.03 to 473F.08, the increase in the net tax capacity of commercial-industrial property in that municipality in the succeeding year, as otherwise computed under section 473F.06, shall be adjusted in a like amount, by an increase if the reassessment or listing discloses a larger increase than was used for purposes of sections 473F.03 to 473F.08, or by a decrease if the reassessment or listing discloses a smaller increase than was used for those purposes, provided that no adjustment shall reduce the amount determined under section 473F.06 to an amount less than zero.\nSubdivisions 1 and 2 shall not apply to the determination of the tax rate under section 473F.08, subdivision 4, or to the determination of the net tax capacity of commercial-industrial property and each item thereof for purposes of section 473F.08, subdivision 6.",
