An administrative review is limited to issues of mistaken identity, a pending legal action involving the arrears, or an incorrect arrears balance; or\n(3) enter into a written payment agreement pursuant to section 518A.69 that is approved by a court, a child support magistrate, or the public authority responsible for child support enforcement.\n(d) A public authority that reports arrearage information under this section must make monthly reports to a consumer reporting agency. The monthly report must be consistent with credit reporting industry standards for child support.\n(e) For purposes of this section, \"consumer reporting agency\" has the meaning given in section 13C.001, subdivision 4, and United States Code, title 15, section 1681a(f).",
