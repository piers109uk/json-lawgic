	"text": "In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the board, acting through its executive director and one or more designated board members without a hearing, may temporarily suspend the license of a regulated person if the executive director and one or more designated board members finds that the regulated person has violated a statute or rule that the board is empowered to enforce and continued practice by the regulated person would create an imminent risk of harm to others. The suspension is in effect upon service of a written temporary suspension order on the regulated person specifying the statute or rule violated. Service of the temporary suspension order is effective upon personal service or service by first class mail upon the regulated person or counsel at the regulated person's or counsel's last known address. The temporary order remains in effect until the board issues an order after a limited hearing described in this subdivision or upon agreement between the board and the regulated person. Within ten days of service of the temporary suspension order, the board shall conduct a limited hearing before its own members on the sole issue of whether there is a reasonable basis for the temporary suspension order to remain in effect. Both parties shall be given an opportunity to present evidence and oral argument at the hearing. Within five business days after the hearing, the board shall issue an order and, if the temporary suspension is to remain in effect, initiate a contested case hearing to be commenced within 45 days after service of the order. The administrative law judge shall issue a report within 30 days after closing the contested case hearing record. The board shall issue a final order within 30 days after receiving the administrative law judge's report.",
