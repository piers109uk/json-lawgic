The commission may prohibit large customer facilities exempt from innovation plan costs from participating in innovation plans.\n(g) A utility filing an innovation plan may include annual spending and investments on research and development of up to ten percent of the proposed total incremental costs related to innovative plans, subject to the limitations in paragraphs (a) to (e).\n(h) For purposes of this subdivision, gross operating revenues do not include revenues from large customer facilities exempt from innovation plan costs.\n(a) Without filing an innovation plan, a natural gas utility may propose and the commission may approve cost recovery for:\n(1) innovative resources acquired to satisfy a commission-approved green tariff program that allows customers to choose to meet a portion of the customers' energy needs through innovative resources; or\n(2) utility expenditures for innovative resources procured at a cost that is within five percent of the average of Ventura and Demarc index prices for natural gas produced from conventional geologic sources at the time of the transaction per unit of natural gas that the innovative resource displaces.\n(b) An approved green tariff program must include provisions to ensure that reasonable systems are used to track and verify the environmental attributes of innovative resources included in the program, taking into account any available third-party tracking or verification systems.\n(c) For the purposes of this subdivision, \"Ventura and Demarc index prices\" means the daily index price of wholesale natural gas sold at the Northern Natural Gas Company's Ventura trading hub in Hancock County, Iowa, and its demarcation point in Clifton, Kansas.\nWhen determining whether to approve a power-to-ammonia pilot program as part of an innovative plan, the commission must consider:\n(1) the risk of exposing any person to unhealthy concentrations of ammonia;\n(2) the risk that any home or business might be affected by ammonia odors;\n(3) whether the greenhouse gas emissions addressed by the proposed power-to-ammonia project could be more efficiently addressed using power-to-hydrogen; and\n(4) whether the power-to-ammonia project achieves lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reductions in the agricultural sector more effectively than power-to-hydrogen.\nThe first innovation plan filed under this section by a utility with more than 800,000 customers must include a pilot program to provide thermal energy audits to small- and medium-sized businesses in order to identify opportunities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas use. The pilot program must provide incentives for businesses to implement recommendations made by the audit. The utility must develop criteria to identify businesses that achieve significant emissions reductions by implementing audit recommendations and must recognize the businesses as thermal energy leaders.\nThe first innovation plan filed under this section by a utility with more than 800,000 customers must include a pilot program to provide innovative resources to industrial facilities whose manufacturing processes, for technical reasons, are not amenable to electrification. A large customer facility exempt from innovation plan offerings under subdivision 3, paragraph (f), is not eligible to participate in the pilot program under this subdivision.\n(a) The first innovation plan filed under this section by a utility with more than 800,000 customers must include a pilot program that facilitates deep energy retrofits and the installation of cold climate electric air-source heat pumps in existing residential homes that have natural gas heating systems.\n(b) For purposes of this subdivision, \"deep energy retrofit\" means the installation of any measure or combination of measures, including air sealing and addressing thermal bridges, that under normal weather and operating conditions can reasonably be expected to reduce a building's calculated design load to ten or fewer British Thermal Units per hour per square foot of conditioned floor area. Deep energy retrofit does not include the installation of photovoltaic electric generation equipment, but may include the installation of a solar thermal energy project.\nThe first innovation plan filed under this section by a utility with more than 800,000 customers must include a pilot program to facilitate the development, expansion, or modification of district energy systems in Minnesota.

If the utility has developed or is developing thermal energy network projects outside of an approved innovation plan, the utility may apply the budget for the projects toward the 15 percent minimum requirement without counting the costs against the limitations on utility customer costs under subdivision 3.\nIt is the goal of the state of Minnesota that through the Natural Gas Innovation Act and Conservation Improvement Program, utilities reduce the overall amount of natural gas produced from conventional geologic sources delivered to customers.\n(a) A public utility filing an innovation plan shall concurrently submit a report to the commission containing the following information:\n(1) the volume of methane gas emissions attributed to venting or leakage across the utility's system, including emissions information reported to the Environmental Protection Agency and gas leaks considered to be hazardous or nonhazardous, and a narrative description of the utility's expectations regarding the cost and performance of the utility's leakage reduction programs over the next five years;\n(2) total system greenhouse gas emissions and greenhouse gas emissions projected to be reduced or avoided through innovative resource investments and energy conservation investments, and a narrative description of the costs required to achieve the reductions over the next five years through investments in innovative resources and energy conservation;\n(3) the quantity of pipe in service in the utility's natural gas network in Minnesota, by material, size, coating, operating pressure, and decade of installation, based on utility information reported to the United States Department of Transportation;\n(4) a narrative description of other significant equipment owned and operated by the utility through which gas is transported or stored, including regulator stations and storage facilities, a discussion of the function of the equipment, how the equipment is maintained, and utility efforts to prevent leaks from the equipment;\n(5) a five-year forecast of fuel prices and anticipated purchases including, as available, natural gas produced from conventional geologic sources, renewable natural gas, and alternative fuels;\n(6) a five-year forecast of potential capital investments by the utility in existing infrastructure and new infrastructure for natural gas produced from conventional geologic sources and for innovative resources; and\n(7) an inventory of the utility's current financial incentive programs for natural gas, including rebates and incentives offered for new and existing buildings and a description of the utility's projected changes in incentives the utility is likely to implement over the next five years.\n(b) Information filed under this subdivision is intended to be used by the commission to evaluate a utility's innovation plan in the context of the utility's other planned investments and activities with respect to natural gas produced from conventional geologic sources. Information filed under this subdivision must not be used by the commission to set or limit utility rate recovery.",
