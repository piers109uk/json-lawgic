	"text": "Whenever a municipality annexes property abutting one side of a township road, the segment of road abutting the annexed property must be treated as a line road and is subject to section 164.14. Whenever a municipality annexes the property on both sides of a township road, that portion of road abutting the annexed property ceases to be a town road and becomes the obligation of the annexing municipality. This section does not prohibit the annexing municipality from contracting with the township for continued maintenance of the road. Any portion of a township road that ceases to be a township road pursuant to this section may still be counted as a township road for the road-and-bridge account revenues for the year in which the annexation occurs.",
