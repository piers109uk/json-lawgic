The termination takes effect on the date specified in the notice of termination, except that the termination does not apply to any loan made on or before the date on which the notice of termination is received by the lender. If the commissioner is terminating the enrollment of loans for all participating lenders under the program, the commissioner shall provide notice of at least 90 days to the lender.
