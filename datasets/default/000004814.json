	"title": "35.67 RABIES INVESTIGATION.",
	"text": "If the executive director of the Board of Animal Health, or a community health board as defined in section 145A.02, subdivision 5, receives a written complaint that rabies exists in a town or city in the board's jurisdiction, the community health board shall investigate, either personally or through subordinate officers, the truth of the complaint. A community health board may also make an investigation and determination independently, without having received a complaint. The fact that a community health board has investigated and determined that rabies does not exist in a jurisdiction does not deprive the executive director of the Board of Animal Health of jurisdiction or authority to make an investigation and determination with reference to the territory. For the purposes of sections 35.67 to 35.69, the jurisdiction of the executive director of the Board of Animal Health is the entire state.",
