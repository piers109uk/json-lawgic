Such record shall be kept in such form that it may be transferred with the child to any school which the child shall attend within the state. It shall contain a record of such student health data as defined in section 13.32, subdivision 2, paragraph (a), and shall be classified as private data as defined in section 13.32, subdivision 3. Nothing in sections 144.29 to 144.32 shall be construed to require any child whose parent or guardian objects in writing thereto to undergo a physical or medical examination or treatment. A copy shall be forwarded to the proper department of any state to which the child shall remove. Each district shall assign a teacher, school nurse, or other professional person to review, at the beginning of each school year, the health record of all pupils under the assignee's direction. Growth, results of vision and hearing screening, and findings obtained from health assessments must be entered periodically on the pupil's health record.",
