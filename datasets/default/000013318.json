	"text": "(a) The legislature finds that:\n(1) the waters of the state, because of their abundant quantity and high natural quality, constitute a unique natural resource of immeasurable value which must be protected and conserved for the benefit of the health, safety, welfare, and economic well-being of present and future generations of the people of the state;\n(2) the actual or potential use of the waters of the state for potable water supply is the highest priority use of that water and deserves maximum protection by the state; and\n(3) the disposal of hazardous waste and radioactive waste in Minnesota may pose a serious risk of pollution of the waters of the state, particularly potable water.\n(b) It is therefore the policy of the state of Minnesota, consistent with the state's primary responsibility and rights to prevent, reduce, and eliminate water pollution and to plan for the preservation of water resources, that depositories for hazardous waste or radioactive waste should not be located in any place or be constructed or operated in any manner that can reasonably be expected to cause pollution of potable water.",
