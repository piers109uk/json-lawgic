The legislature further declares that it desires to protect residents of this state against acts by insurers not authorized to do an insurance business in this state, to maintain fair and honest insurance markets, to protect the premium tax revenues of this state, to protect authorized insurers who are subject to strict regulation from unfair competition by unauthorized insurers, and to protect against the evasion of the insurance regulatory laws of this state. In furtherance of the state interest, the legislature herein provides a method for substituted service of process upon unauthorized insurers. The legislature declares that in so doing it exercises its power to protect residents of this state and to define what constitutes doing an insurance business in this state, and also exercises powers and privileges available to this state by virtue of Public Law 79-15, Statutes at Large, volume 59, page 33, as amended, which declares that the business of insurance and every person engaged therein shall be subject to the laws of the several states.",
