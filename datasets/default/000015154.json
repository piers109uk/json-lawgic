	"text": "(a) Notwithstanding section 151.37, districts and schools may obtain and possess epinephrine auto-injectors to be maintained and administered by school personnel, including a licensed nurse, to a student or other individual if, in good faith, it is determined that person is experiencing anaphylaxis regardless of whether the student or other individual has a prescription for an epinephrine auto-injector. The administration of an epinephrine auto-injector in accordance with this section is not the practice of medicine.\n(b) Registered nurses may administer epinephrine auto-injectors in a school setting according to a condition-specific protocol as authorized under section 148.235, subdivision 8. Notwithstanding any limitation in sections 148.171 to 148.285, licensed practical nurses may administer epinephrine auto-injectors in a school setting according to a condition-specific protocol that does not reference a specific patient and that specifies the circumstances under which the epinephrine auto-injector is to be administered, when caring for a patient whose condition falls within the protocol.\nA district or school may enter into arrangements with manufacturers of epinephrine auto-injectors to obtain epinephrine auto-injectors at fair-market, free, or reduced prices. A third party, other than a manufacturer or supplier, may pay for a school's supply of epinephrine auto-injectors.",
