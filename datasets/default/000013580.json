	"text": "(a) It is the intent of the legislature that if a bottle deposit return system is enacted in the future, it will be harmonized with sections 115A.144 to 115A.1463 in a manner that ensures that:\n(1) materials covered in that system are exempt from sections 115A.144 to 115A.1463 or related financial obligations are reduced;\n(2) colocation of drop-off collection sites is maximized;\n(3) education and outreach is integrated between the two programs; and\n(4) waste reduction and reuse strategies are prioritized between the two programs.\n(b) Any implementation of a deposit return system must include a two-year transition period before the expiration of the currently approved stewardship plan and be conducted in a manner that does not create sudden and significant operational or financial disruption to the implementation of a stewardship plan under section 115A.1451, including provisions of recycling or reuse services contained in the plan.",
