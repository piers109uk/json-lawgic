	"text": "Within 60 days of May 20, 2009, each utility, as defined in section 216B.1691, subdivision 1, paragraph (d), shall file with the commission a standardized contract form for the purchase of electricity from projects with a nameplate capacity of five megawatts or less. The standardized contract form must be similar in all material respects to the standard contract form previously filed with the commission under section 216B.2423, subdivision 3, including any revisions to that contract on file with the commission as of May 20, 2009. After consultation with wind developers and producers, a utility governed by this section may modify the standardized contract currently on file under section 216B.2423 prior to submitting its standard contract form under this section if the modifications are reasonably necessary to account for circumstances that are unique to that particular utility. The commission shall not approve a contract that is not in compliance with this section.",
