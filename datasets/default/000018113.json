	"text": "The mission of the board is to provide programs of study that meet the needs of students for occupational, general, baccalaureate, and graduate education. The state universities, community colleges, and technical colleges shall have distinct missions as provided in section 135A.052, subdivision 1. Within that statutory definition and subject to the approval of the board, each community college, state university, and technical college may develop its own distinct campus mission. The board shall develop administrative arrangements that make possible the efficient use of the facilities and staff of the technical colleges, community colleges, and state universities for providing these several different programs of study, so that students may have the benefit of improved and broader course offerings, ease of transfer among schools and programs, integrated course credit, coordinated degree programs, and coordinated financial aid. The board shall control administrative costs by eliminating duplicative administrative positions and course offerings.",
