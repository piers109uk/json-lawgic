	"text": "The commissioner may issue a license to a bona fide religious book or supply store for the importation and sale of wine exclusively for sacramental purposes. The holder of a sacramental wine license may sell wine intended by the manufacturer or the wholesaler for sacramental purposes only to a rabbi, priest, or minister of a church, or other established religious organization, if the purchaser certifies in writing that the wine will be used exclusively for sacramental purposes in religious ceremonies. The annual fee for a sacramental wine license is $50, inclusive of a retail card required under Minnesota Rules, part 7515.0210. A seller of sacramental wine does not need insurance required under section 340A.409.
