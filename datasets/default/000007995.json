The health plan company shall be financially liable for the evaluation if performed by a participating provider of the health plan company and shall be financially liable for the care included in the court-ordered individual treatment plan if the care is covered by the health plan and ordered to be provided by a participating provider or another provider as required by rule or law. This court-ordered coverage must not be subject to a separate medical necessity determination by a health plan company under its utilization procedures.\n(b) A party or interested person, including a health plan company or its designee, may make a motion for modification of the court-ordered plan of care pursuant to the applicable rules of procedure for modification of the court's order.
