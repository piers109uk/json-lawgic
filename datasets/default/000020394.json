	"text": "A physical therapist or physical therapist assistant holding an active license to practice physical therapy in the state may, upon approval of the board, be granted license cancellation if the board is not investigating the person as a result of a complaint or information received or if the board has not begun disciplinary proceedings against the person. Such action by the board shall be reported as a cancellation of a license in good standing.\nA physical therapist or physical therapist assistant who receives board approval for license cancellation is not entitled to a refund of any license fees paid for the licensure year in which cancellation of the license occurred.\nIf a physical therapist or physical therapist assistant who has been granted board approval for license cancellation desires to resume the practice of physical therapy in Minnesota, that physical therapist or physical therapist assistant must obtain a new license by applying for licensure and fulfilling the requirements then in existence for obtaining an initial license to practice physical therapy in Minnesota.",
