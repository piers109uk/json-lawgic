The proceeds of the sale of such certificates shall be used solely for the purposes for which such tax collections and other revenues are to be expended pursuant to such budget. All such tax collections and other revenues included in the budget for such budget year, after the expenditure of such tax collections and other revenues in accordance with the budget, shall be irrevocably pledged and appropriated to a special fund to pay the principal and interest on the certificates when due. If for any reason such tax collections and other revenues are insufficient to pay the certificates and interest when due, the board shall levy a tax in the amount of the deficiency on all taxable property in the district and shall appropriate this amount when received to the special fund.\nMS 1996 [Repealed, 1998 c 254 art 1 s 89]\nIf in any budget year the receipts of tax and other revenues should for some unforeseen cause become insufficient to pay the board's current expenses, or if any calamity or other public emergency should subject it to the necessity of making extraordinary expenditures, the board may by resolution authorize the issuance, negotiation, and sale in accordance with subdivision 5 in such form and manner and upon such terms and conditions as it may determine of its negotiable general obligation certificates of indebtedness in an amount sufficient to meet such deficiency and the board shall forthwith levy on all taxable property in the district a tax sufficient to pay the certificates and interest thereon, and shall appropriate all collections of such tax to a special fund created for the payment of such certificates and the interest thereon.

The board may also pledge for the payment of such bonds any revenues receivable under section 458D.11.\nCertificates issued under subdivisions 1, 2, and 3 may be issued and sold by negotiation, without public sale, and may be sold at a price equal to such percentage of the par value thereof, plus accrued interest, and bearing interest at such rate or rates as may be determined by the board.
