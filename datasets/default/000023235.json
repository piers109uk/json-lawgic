A petition by an exclusive representative shall be signed by its authorized officer. All petitions shall be served on the commissioner in writing. The petition shall state briefly the nature of the disagreement of the parties.\n(b) Upon receipt of a petition and upon concluding that mediation would be useful, the commissioner shall fix a time and place for a meeting with the parties to negotiate the issues not agreed upon, and shall then take the most expedient steps to bring about a settlement, including assisting in negotiating and drafting an agreement.\nIf the commissioner determines that mediation would be useful in resolving a dispute, the commissioner may mediate the dispute even if neither party has filed a petition for mediation. In these cases, the commissioner shall proceed as if a petition had been filed.\nThe commissioner shall not furnish mediation services to any employee or employee representative who is not certified as an exclusive representative.\nAll parties shall respond to the summons of the commissioner for meetings and shall continue meeting until excused by the commissioner.",
