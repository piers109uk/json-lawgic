	"text": "The county treasurer shall prepare and send a sufficient number of copies of the property tax statement to the owner, and to the owner's escrow agent if the taxes are paid via an escrow account, to enable the owner to comply with the filing requirements of this chapter and to retain one copy as a record. The property tax statement, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, shall indicate the manner in which the claimant may claim relief from the state under both this chapter and chapter 290B, and the amount of the tax for which the applicant may claim relief. The statement shall also indicate if there are delinquent property taxes on the property in the preceding year. Taxes included in a confession of judgment under section 277.23 or 279.37 shall not constitute delinquent taxes as long as the claimant is current on the payments required to be made under section 277.23 or 279.37.",
