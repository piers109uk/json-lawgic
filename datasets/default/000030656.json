	"text": "The legislature hereby declares that the public policy of this state is to protect children whose health or welfare may be jeopardized through maltreatment. While it is recognized that most parents want to keep their children safe, sometimes circumstances or conditions interfere with their ability to do so. When this occurs, the health and safety of the children must be of paramount concern. Intervention and prevention efforts must address immediate concerns for child safety and the ongoing risk of maltreatment and should engage the protective capacities of families. In furtherance of this public policy, it is the intent of the legislature under this chapter to:\n(1) protect children and promote child safety;\n(2) strengthen the family;\n(3) make the home, school, and community safe for children by promoting responsible child care in all settings, including through the reporting of child maltreatment;\n(4) provide protective, family support, and family preservation services when appropriate; and\n(5) provide, when necessary, a safe temporary or permanent home environment for maltreated children.",
