	"text": "Any person having an insurable interest in real or tangible personal property who has been canceled, nonrenewed, or otherwise rejected for coverage in the private market may submit an application for coverage to the plan. If an inspection of the premises is performed, it must be done at no cost to the applicant.\nBefore the plan may deny coverage due to the condition of the property or write coverage with a condition charge, it must first inspect the property for which coverage has been requested. The manner and scope of the inspections of Minnesota FAIR plan business must be prescribed by the plan with the approval of the commissioner.\nAn inspection report must be made for each property inspected. The report must cover pertinent structural and occupancy features as well as the general condition of the building and surrounding structures. A representative photograph of the property may be taken during the inspection.\nEither during the inspection or immediately after the inspection, an employee of the FAIR plan shall inform the applicant as to the features that result in a condition charge if the risk is accepted. No inspector has the authority to advise whether the plan will provide the coverage.\nWithin ten business days after the inspection, the FAIR plan shall prepare or have prepared a completed inspection report that includes conditions that are subject to a condition charge under the rating plan approved by the commissioner. A copy of the inspection report must be made available to the applicant or the applicant's agent upon request.\n[Repealed by amendment, 2003 c 40 s 11]",
