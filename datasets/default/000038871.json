	"text": "All filing officers must perform the responsibilities in sections 336.9-501 to 336.9-530 and rules adopted under Laws 2000, chapter 399, article 1, section 139 in a uniform manner, whether services are provided by the secretary of state or at a satellite office location. Reports by citizens describing concerns with performance of filing officer responsibilities must be made to the secretary of state. The secretary of state is responsible for responding to reports about performance in a manner the secretary of state determines is appropriate.\nIf, upon investigation of citizen reports described in subdivision 1, the secretary of state determines that performance by a satellite office of the filing officer responsibilities has been so unsatisfactory that customer service has been severely impaired, the secretary of state must terminate the satellite office's status and ability to perform filing office responsibilities. If a satellite office's ability to perform filing office responsibilities is terminated by the secretary of state, the change in status must be posted in the former satellite office and must also be publicly posted in the county courthouse in the county in which the former satellite office is located and must be made available in an electronic format.",
