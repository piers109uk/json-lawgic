The surrender does not affect the licensee's civil or criminal liability for acts committed before the surrender, or affect the liability on the bond required by sections 53A.01 to 53A.13, or entitle the licensee to a return of any part of any license fee.\n(c) Before suspension or revocation of the license, the commissioner may fine a licensee for violations of this chapter as authorized under chapter 45.",
