	"text": "Packaging forms a substantial portion of solid waste and contributes to environmental degradation and the costs of managing solid waste. It is imperative to reduce the amount and toxicity of packaging that must be managed as solid waste. In order to achieve significant reduction of packaging in solid waste, the goal of the state is that items be distributed without any packaging where feasible and, only when necessary to protect health and safety or product integrity, with the minimal amount of packaging possible. The following categories of packaging are listed in order of preference for use by all persons who find it necessary to package items for distribution or use in the state:\n(1) minimal packaging that contains no intentionally introduced toxic materials and that is designed to be and actually is reused for its original purpose at least five times;\n(2) minimal packaging that contains no intentionally introduced toxic materials and consists of a significant percentage of postconsumer material;\n(3) minimal packaging that contains no intentionally introduced toxic materials, that is recyclable, and is regularly collected through recycling collection programs available to at least 75 percent of the residents of the state;\n(4) minimal packaging that does not comply with clause (1), (2), or (3) because it is required under federal or state law and for which there does not exist a commercially feasible alternative that does comply with clause (1), (2), or (3);\n(5) packaging that contains no intentionally introduced toxic materials but does not comply with clauses (1) to (4); and\n(6) all other packaging.",
