	"text": "The legislature finds that:\n(1) the diversity inherent in Minnesota folklife has contributed greatly to the cultural richness of the state and has fostered a sense of individuality and identity among its people;\n(2) the history of the state of Minnesota effectively demonstrates that building a strong state does not require the sacrifice of cultural differences;\n(3) folklife has a fundamental influence on the desires, beliefs, values, and character of the people;\n(4) it is appropriate and necessary for the state to support research and scholarship in Minnesota folklife in order to contribute to an understanding of the complex problems of the basic desires, beliefs, and values of people in both rural and urban areas;\n(5) the encouragement and support of Minnesota folklife and the study thereof, while primarily a matter for private and local initiative, is also an appropriate matter of concern to the state government; and\n(6) it is in the interest of the general welfare of the nation to preserve, support, revitalize, and disseminate Minnesota folklife traditions and arts.\nIt is the purpose of sections 138.81 to 138.87 to establish in the Minnesota Historical Society a center for the study of Minnesota folklife and the position of state folklorist to develop, promote, and implement a program of support for and research in Minnesota folklife.",
