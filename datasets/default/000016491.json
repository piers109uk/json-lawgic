	"text": "A district that offers a school-age care program according to section 124D.19, subdivision 11, is eligible for school-age care revenue for the additional costs of providing services to children with disabilities or to children experiencing family or related problems of a temporary nature who participate in the school-age care program.\nThe school-age care revenue for an eligible district equals the approved additional cost of providing services to children with disabilities or children experiencing family or related problems of a temporary nature who participate in the school-age care program.\nTo obtain school-age care revenue, a school district may levy an amount equal to the district's school-age care revenue as defined in subdivision 2 multiplied by the lesser of one, or the ratio of the quotient derived by dividing the adjusted net tax capacity of the district for the year before the year the levy is certified by the resident pupil units in the district for the school year to which the levy is attributable, to $2,318.\nA district's school-age care aid is the difference between its school-age care revenue and its school-age care levy. If a district does not levy the entire amount permitted, school-age care aid must be reduced in proportion to the actual amount levied.",
