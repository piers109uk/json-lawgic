	"text": "For the purposes of this section:\n(1) \"origin\" means a general geographical description that at a minimum names the local governmental unit within a county from which waste was collected; and\n(2) \"type\" means a best estimate of the percentage of each truck load that consists of residential, commercial, industrial, construction, or any other general type of waste.\n(a) Each person who collects solid waste in a county in which a designation ordinance is in effect shall maintain records regarding the volume or weight, type, and origin of waste collected. Each day, a record of the origin, type, and weight of the waste collected that day and the identity of the waste facility at which that day's collected waste is deposited must be kept on the waste collection vehicle. If the waste is measured by volume at the waste facility at which it is deposited, the record may show the volume rather than the weight of the waste.\n(b) The owner or operator of a solid waste facility shall maintain records regarding the weight of the waste, or the volume of the waste if the waste is measured by volume; the general type or types of waste; the origin of the waste delivered to the facility; the date and time of delivery; and the name of the waste collector that delivered the waste to the facility.\n(a) A person authorized by a county in which a designation ordinance is effective may, anywhere in the state:\n(1) upon presentation of identification and without a search warrant, inspect or copy the records required to be kept on a waste collection vehicle under subdivision 2 and inspect the waste on the vehicle at the time of deposit of the waste at a facility;\n(2) when reasonable notice under the circumstances has been given, upon presentation of identification and without a search warrant, inspect or copy the records of an owner or operator of a solid waste facility that are required to be maintained under subdivision 2;\n(3) request, in writing, copies of records of a solid waste collector that indicate the type, origin, and weight or, if applicable, the volume of waste collected, the identity of the facility at which the waste was deposited, and the date of deposit at the facility; and\n(4) upon presentation of identification and without a search warrant, inspect or copy that portion of the business records of a waste collector necessary to comply with clause (3) at the central record-keeping location of the waste collector only if the collector fails to provide copies of the records within 15 days of receipt of a written request for them, unless the time has been extended by agreement of the parties.\n(b) Records or information received, inspected, or copied by a county under this section are classified as nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 9, and may be used by the county solely for enforcement of a designation ordinance. A waste collector or the owner or operator of a waste facility shall maintain business records needed to comply with this section for two years.\n(a) A person who fails to comply with this section is subject to:\n(1) an action to compel performance or to restrain or enjoin any activity that interferes with the requirement to keep records in subdivision 2 or the requirement to allow timely entry and inspection in subdivision 3;\n(2) damages caused by the failure to keep records or by refusal to allow timely entry or inspection;\n(3) a civil penalty payable to the county seeking enforcement of up to $10,000 per day for each day of refusal to allow timely entry or inspection; or\n(4) any or all of the above.\n(b) A county in which a designation ordinance is in effect may enforce this section by commencing an action in district court in the county in which the facility is located or in the county in which the designation ordinance is in effect. The court may compel performance in any manner deemed appropriate by the court, including, but not limited to, issuance of an order to show cause, a temporary restraining order, or an injunction. In addition, the court may order payment of damages or a civil penalty or both. In an action brought by a county to enforce this section in which the county substantially prevails, the court may order payment by the defendant of the county's costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney fees.",
