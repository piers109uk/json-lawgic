	"text": "(a) Whenever ice conditions on a body of water deteriorate to such an extent that there is substantial danger to persons using motorized vehicles, including snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles, the sheriff of the county where the body of water is located may prohibit or restrict the use of motorized vehicles on all or a portion of the body of water. If the body of water is located in more than one county, all counties involved must coordinate any prohibitions or restrictions that are imposed. A county sheriff acting under this section shall, as soon as practicable, post all common access sites and publicize the prohibitions or restrictions. The commissioner must be notified immediately and may review and suspend any restrictions imposed. Restrictions may be lifted as soon as conditions warrant.\n(b) A person may not operate a motorized vehicle in violation of a prohibition or restriction imposed under this section.\n(c) This section does not apply to a person who:\n(1) is a member of a sanctioned circuit watercross association and can provide proof of membership;\n(2) operates a snowmobile with a silenced exhaust and is practicing for a sanctioned event; and\n(3) receives written permission from a conservation officer who must set the date, time, and location of the practice.",
