	"text": "All government entities shall be governed by this chapter.\nThis chapter may be cited as the \"Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.\"\nThis chapter regulates the collection, creation, storage, maintenance, dissemination, and access to government data in government entities. It establishes a presumption that government data are public and are accessible by the public for both inspection and copying unless there is federal law, a state statute, or a temporary classification of data that provides that certain data are not public.\nThe headnotes printed in boldface type before paragraphs in this chapter are mere catchwords to indicate the content of a paragraph and are not part of the statute.\n(a) The sections referenced in this chapter that are codified outside this chapter classify government data as other than public, place restrictions on access to government data, or involve data sharing.\n(b) Those sections are governed by the definitions and general provisions in sections 13.01 to 13.07 and the remedies and penalties provided in sections 13.08 and 13.09, except:\n(1) for records of the judiciary, as provided in section 13.90; or\n(2) as specifically provided otherwise by law.",
