Qualified brewers may take the credit on the 18th day of each month, but the total credit allowed may not exceed in any fiscal year the lesser of:\n(1) the liability for tax; or\n(2) $115,000.\nFor purposes of this subdivision, a \"qualified brewer\" means a brewer, whether or not located in this state, manufacturing less than 250,000 barrels of fermented malt beverages in the calendar year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the credit under this subdivision is claimed. In determining the number of barrels, all brands or labels of a brewer must be combined.
