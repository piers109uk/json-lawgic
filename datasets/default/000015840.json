	"text": "The legislature recognizes a growing and substantial concern about the effectiveness and breadth of the existing undergraduate curriculum for teacher education students. It also recognizes the absence of definitive research about the most effective curricula to adequately prepare teachers for entrance into the teaching profession. The purpose of this section is to support research on the comparative effectiveness of different teacher education program structures, after new programs have been designed and implemented, and the first graduates are in service.\nBy July 1, 1989, the Board of Teaching must begin to evaluate the effectiveness of prebaccalaureate, postbaccalaureate, and other alternative program structures for preparing candidates for entrance into the teaching profession. The evaluation shall be conducted by independent research centers or evaluators who are not associated with a Minnesota teacher education institution and shall be longitudinal in nature.",
