	"text": "The lender shall file quarterly reports with the commissioner indicating the number and aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans as of the end of each quarter. A quarterly report is not required for any quarter that ends with a balance in the reserve fund of zero, except that a calendar year-end report must be filed. In computing the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans, the balance of any loan may not be greater than the covered amount of the loan as enrolled.\n(a) If reports filed under this section indicate that for the immediately preceding 24-month period the balance in the reserve fund continually exceeded the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans, the commissioner may withdraw from the reserve fund, on or before the last day of the month for which a report is due, an amount not greater than the amount by which the reserve fund balance exceeded the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans as of the most recent report, unless the lender has provided to the commissioner adequate documentation that at some time during that 24-month period the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans exceeded the balance then in the reserve fund. Any amounts withdrawn from the reserve fund must be transferred to the account.\n(b) If a report is not filed within 30 days of its original due date, the commissioner may withdraw from the reserve fund based on the commissioner's determination from an inspection of the lender's files an amount not greater than the amount by which the reserve fund balance exceeded the aggregate outstanding balance of all enrolled loans as of the date for which the report was required to be filed.",
