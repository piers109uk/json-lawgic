	"text": "For purposes of this chapter, the words defined in section 120A.05 have the same meaning.\n\"Dyslexia\" means a specific learning disability that is neurological in origin. It is characterized by difficulties with accurate or fluent recognition of words and by poor spelling and decoding abilities. These difficulties typically result from a deficit in the phonological component of language that is often unexpected in relation to other cognitive abilities and the provision of effective classroom instruction. Secondary consequences may include problems in reading comprehension and reduced reading experience that can impede the growth of vocabulary and background knowledge.\nStudents who have a dyslexia diagnosis must meet the state and federal eligibility criteria in order to qualify for special education services.",
