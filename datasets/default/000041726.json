	"text": "The members of the commission shall receive no compensation, but the commission may employ an attorney and other personnel to assist in framing the charter, and any amendment or revision of it. When so directed by the commission, the reasonable compensation of personnel, the cost of printing the charter or any amendment or revision of it, and the cost of informing the citizens of a suggested charter or suggested charter amendments or revisions, shall be paid by the city. The amount of reasonable and necessary charter commission expenses that shall be paid by the city is the greater of .07 percent of the city's current certified general property tax levy or $1,500, not to exceed $20,000 in any one year, but the council may authorize such additional charter commission expenses the commission considers necessary. Other statutory and charter provisions requiring budgeting of or limiting expenditures do not apply to charter commission expenses. The council may levy a tax in excess of charter tax limitations to pay the expenses.",
