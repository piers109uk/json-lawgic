The court may order this payment in addition to any other penalty authorized by law which it may impose. The payment of the disbursements of prosecution may be enforced in the same manner as the sentence, or by execution against property. When collected, the disbursements of ordered prosecution costs shall be paid to the municipality or subdivision of government which employed the prosecuting attorney or otherwise provided for prosecution of the case. This payment may not interfere with the payment of officers', witnesses', or jurors' fees.",
