Such writing shall be recorded by the secretary. No service by publication of summons shall be made upon any such nonresident who has complied with the provisions hereof, but in all such cases service of such process or summons, or of any writ or notice in the action or proceedings, shall be made upon such agent in the manner provided by law for such service upon residents of the state, and have the same effect as personal service within the state upon such owner or claimant; but, if such party appears by attorneys therein, the service of papers shall thereafter be upon such attorney.
