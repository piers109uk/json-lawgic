	"text": "Judgment in the cases mentioned in section 548.22 may also be entered in the district court in the manner therein provided, and with like effect, upon filing with the court administrator a plea of confession signed by an attorney of such court, together with an instrument signed by the debtor authorizing such confession; but such instrument must be distinct from that containing the bond, contract, or other evidence of the demand for which judgment is confessed. Any person filing a plea of confession and an instrument under this section shall pay the same fee as provided for filing a civil action in district court; except that if the amount of the judgment confessed is not greater than the jurisdictional limit of the conciliation court, the fee shall be in the amount of the filing fee for an action in conciliation court.",
