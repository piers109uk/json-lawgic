The requests must be submitted in the form and with the supporting documentation required by the commissioner of management and budget. All requests timely received by the commissioner must be submitted to the legislature, along with the governor's recommendations, whether or not the governor recommends that a request be funded, by the deadline established in section 16A.11, subdivision 1.\n[Repealed, 2009 c 93 art 1 s 47]\nAll requests for state assistance under this section must include the following information:\n(1) the name of the political subdivision that will own the capital project for which state assistance is being requested;\n(2) the public purpose of the project;\n(3) the extent to which the political subdivision has or expects to provide local, private, user financing, or other nonstate funding for the project;\n(4) a list of the bondable activities that the project encompasses; examples of bondable activities are public improvements of a capital nature for land acquisition, predesign, design, construction, and furnishing and equipping for occupancy;\n(5) whether the project will require new or additional state operating subsidies;\n(6) whether the governing body of the political subdivision requesting the project has passed a resolution in support of the project and has established priorities for all projects within its jurisdiction for which bonding appropriations are requested when submitting multiple requests;\n(7) if the project requires a predesign under section 16B.335, whether the predesign has been completed at the time the capital project request is submitted, and whether the political subdivision has submitted the project predesign to the commissioner of administration for review and approval; and\n(8) if applicable, the information required under section 473.4485, subdivision 1a.\n(a) The state share of a project covered by this section must be no more than half the total cost of the project, including predesign, design, construction, furnishings, and equipment, except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c). This subdivision does not apply to a project proposed by a school district or other school organization.\n(b) The state share may be more than half the total cost of a project if the project is deemed needed as a result of a disaster or to prevent a disaster or is located in a political subdivision with a very low average net tax capacity.\n(c) Nothing in this section prevents the governor from recommending, or the legislature from considering or funding, projects that do not meet the deadline in subdivision 2 or a state share that is greater than half the total cost of the project when the governor or the legislature determines that there is a compelling reason for the recommendation or funding.",
