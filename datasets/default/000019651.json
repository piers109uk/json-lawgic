	"text": "A person holding a license to practice medicine in the state may, upon approval of the board, be granted license cancellation if the board is not investigating the person as a result of a complaint or information received or if the board has not begun disciplinary proceedings against the person. Such action by the board must be reported as a cancellation of a license in good standing.\nA person who receives board approval for license cancellation is not entitled to a refund of any license fees paid for the licensure year in which cancellation of the license occurred.\nIf a person who has been granted board approval for license cancellation desires to resume the practice of medicine in Minnesota, that person must obtain a new license by applying for licensure and fulfilling the requirements then in existence for obtaining an initial license to practice medicine in Minnesota.",
