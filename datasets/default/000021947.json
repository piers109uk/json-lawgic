	"text": "Abandoned motor vehicles constitute a hazard to the health and welfare of the people of the state in that such vehicles can harbor noxious diseases, furnish shelter and breeding places for vermin, and present physical dangers to the safety and well-being of children and other citizens. Abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metals also constitute a blight on the landscape of the state and therefore a detriment to the environment. The abandonment and retirement of motor vehicles and other scrap metals constitutes a waste of a valuable source of useful metal. It is therefore in the public interest that the present accumulation of abandoned motor vehicles and other scrap metals be eliminated, that future abandonment of motor vehicles and other scrap metals be prevented, that the expansion of existing scrap recycling facilities be developed and that other acceptable and economically useful methods for the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles and other forms of scrap metal be developed.",
