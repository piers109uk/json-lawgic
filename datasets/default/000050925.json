	"text": "Instead of the order provided for in section 575.02, upon proof by affidavit that there is danger that the debtor will leave the state or hide, the judge may issue a warrant requiring the sheriff of any county where the debtor is to arrest and bring the debtor before such judge to answer concerning the debtor's property. Upon being brought before the judge, the debtor may be examined on oath, and ordered to give bond that the debtor will attend, from time to time, before the judge or referee, as directed, during the pendency of the proceeding, and will not in the meantime dispose of any portion of property not exempt from execution; and, in default of giving such bond, the debtor may be committed to jail as for a contempt.",
