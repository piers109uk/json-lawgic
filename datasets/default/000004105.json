	"text": "The department may supervise, regulate, and, in the manner provided by law make reasonable rules relative to grading, candling, cleaning, breaking, purchasing, and selling of eggs and egg products for purpose of preserving and protecting the public health. In addition hereto, it is the express purpose herein that inasmuch as the breaking of eggs for resale is a matter of state concern, the surroundings in which such product is handled must be maintained in a sanitary condition, and, therefore, the department may establish, in the manner provided by law, reasonable rules relative to the inspection of all establishments wherein the business of breaking eggs for resale is maintained, and when the sanitary conditions of any such establishment are such that the product is rendered, or is likely to be rendered, unclean, unsound, unhealthful, unwholesome, or otherwise unfit for human consumption, it may revoke such license to break eggs for resale until such time as the department is satisfied that the establishment is maintained in a sanitary condition. The department shall have the right, from time to time, to adopt rules in the same manner as herein set forth. All liquid, frozen or dried egg products sold or offered for sale shall be processed under continuous supervision of an inspector of the department or of the United States Department of Agriculture.",
