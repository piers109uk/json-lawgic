	"text": "(a) By December 31 of each year, the commissioner shall issue a public report providing statistics for the previous calendar year compiled from the data submitted under sections 145.4131 to 145.4133 and sections 145.4241 to 145.4249. Each report shall provide the statistics for all previous calendar years, adjusted to reflect any additional information from late or corrected reports. The commissioner shall ensure that none of the information included in the public reports can reasonably lead to identification of an individual having performed or having had an abortion. All data included on the forms under section 145.4131 must be included in the public report, except that the commissioner shall maintain as confidential, data which alone or in combination may constitute information from which an individual having performed or having had an abortion may be identified using epidemiologic principles.\n(b) The commissioner may, by rules adopted under chapter 14, alter the submission dates established under section 145.4131 for administrative convenience, fiscal savings, or other valid reason, provided that physicians or facilities submit the required information once each year and the commissioner issues a report once each year.",
