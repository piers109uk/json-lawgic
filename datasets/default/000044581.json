	"text": "The legislature determines that in the lower St. Louis River basin area there are serious problems of water pollution and disposal of sewage and solid waste which cannot be effectively or economically dealt with by existing government units under existing laws. The legislature, therefore, declares that for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the area, for the preservation and best use of waters, land and other natural resources of the state in the area, for the prevention, control and abatement of water pollution and disposal of solid waste in the area, and for the efficient and economic collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and solid waste, it is necessary to establish in Minnesota for said area a sanitary board assigned the responsibility of carrying on a continuous long range program of planning with respect thereto and given the authority to take over, acquire, construct, better, administer, operate and maintain any and all interceptors and treatment works needed for the collection, treatment and disposal of sewage and solid waste in such area, as well as local sanitary sewer facilities over which the board agrees to assume responsibility at the request of any local government unit. The board may construct, operate and regulate solid waste disposal sites and facilities.",
