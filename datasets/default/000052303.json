	"text": "Upon request of the prosecutor, defense counsel, or head of the treatment facility and approval by the court and the treatment facility, a hearing may be held at a treatment facility. A hearing may be conducted by interactive video conference consistent with the Minnesota Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nWhen a medical professional treating the defendant submits a written report stating that participating in a hearing under this statute is not in the best interest of the defendant and would be detrimental to the defendant's mental or physical health, the court shall notify the defense counsel and the defendant and allow the hearing to proceed without the defendant's participation.\nAt any hearing required under this section, the court, on its motion or on the motion of any party, may exclude or excuse a defendant who is seriously disruptive, refuses to participate, or who is incapable of comprehending and participating in the proceedings. In such instances, the court shall, with specificity on the record, state the behavior of the defendant or other circumstances which justify proceeding in the absence of the defendant.\nThe defendant's incompetence does not preclude the defense counsel from making an objection or defense before trial that can be fairly determined without the defendant's participation.",
