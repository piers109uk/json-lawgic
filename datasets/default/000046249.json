	"text": "A county may terminate its participation in the district only as provided by other law. If a county terminates its participation in the district, an appraisal of the property of the commission shall be made by a board of appraisers and the value determined as of the termination date. The board shall be three members, one appointed by the terminated county, one by the remaining counties within the district, and the third by the first two. If the first two appraisers cannot agree to the appointment of the third appraiser within 30 days, the commission shall appoint the third appraiser. An amount equal to the withdrawing county's share in the net assets of the commission proportionate to its financial contribution to the metropolitan mosquito control fund shall be paid to the treasurer of the terminated county. If a participating county furnishes specific funds and materials to be used in special projects, they shall be returned to it. If the district is dissolved, all property of the commission shall be sold and the proceeds remaining after the payment of the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the district, along with any balance in the fund, shall be paid to the counties which are members of the district in proportion to their financial contributions.",
