	"text": "(a) Contract reserves are required, unless otherwise specified in paragraph (b) for:\n(1) all individual and group contracts with which level premiums are used; or\n(2) all individual and group contracts with respect to which, due to the gross premium pricing structure at issue, the value of the future benefits at any time exceeds the value of any appropriate future valuation net premiums at that time. This evaluation may be applied on a rating block basis if the total premiums for the block were developed to support the total risk assumed and expected expenses for the block each year, and a qualified actuary certifies the premium development. The actuary must state in the certification that premiums for the rating block were developed such that each year's premium was intended to cover that year's costs without any prefunding. If the premium is also intended to recover costs for any prior years, the actuary must also disclose the reasons for and magnitude of the recovery. The values specified in this clause must be determined on the basis specified in section 60A.766, subdivisions 1 to 4.\n(b) Contracts not requiring a contract reserve are:\n(1) contracts that cannot be continued after one year from issue; or\n(2) contracts already in force on August 1, 2004, for which no contract reserve was required under the immediately preceding standards.\n(c) The contract reserve is in addition to claim reserves and premium reserves.\n(d) The methods and procedures for contract reserves must be consistent with those for claim reserves for a contract, or else appropriate adjustment must be made when necessary to assure provision for the aggregate liability. The definition of the date of incurral must be the same in both determinations.",
