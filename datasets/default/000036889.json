Section 8.31 may also be employed to remedy violations of paragraph (a).\n(c) For the purposes of paragraph (a):\n(1) the consent of the telephone service subscriber may be verified utilizing any method that is consistent with federal law or regulation;\n(2) compliance with applicable federal law and regulation, or state law and rule, whichever is more stringent, is a complete defense to an allegation of consumer fraud under paragraph (a); and\n(3) it is the responsibility of the company or carrier requesting a change in a telephone service subscriber's company or carrier to verify that the subscriber has authorized the change. A telephone company or telecommunications carrier providing local exchange service who has been requested by another telephone company or telecommunications carrier to process a change in a subscriber's carrier is only liable under this section if it knowingly participates in processing a requested change that is unauthorized.\nNothing in this section shall be construed to change a telephone company's or telecommunications carrier's obligations under section 237.66.",
