This requirement will not apply to life insurers who mail a copy of the signed, completed application to the applicant within 24 hours of receiving the application. However, where an individual life policy is marketed on a direct response basis, a copy of any application signed by the applicant shall be delivered to the insured along with, or as part of, the policy.",
