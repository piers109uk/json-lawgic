	"text": "When a judgment is entered against or a settlement is made by a municipality for a claim within the scope of section 466.02, payment shall be made and the same remedies shall apply in case of nonpayment as in the case of other judgments or settlements against the municipality. If the municipality has the authority to levy taxes and the judgment or settlement is unpaid at the time of the annual tax levy, the governing body shall, if it finds that other funds are not available for payment of the judgment, levy a tax sufficient to pay the judgment or settlement and interest accruing thereon to the expected time of payment. Such tax may be levied in excess of any per capita or local tax rate tax limitation imposed by statute or charter.",
