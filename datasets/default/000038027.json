	"text": "Unless there is a written loan agreement to the contrary, a museum may apply conservation measures to property on loan to the museum without the lender's permission or formal notice if action is required to protect the property on loan or other property in the custody of the museum, or the property on loan is a hazard to the health and safety of the public or the museum staff, and either:\n(1) the museum is unable to reach the lender at the lender's last known address within three days before the time the museum determines action is necessary; or\n(2) the lender does not respond or will not agree to the protective measures the museum recommends and does not terminate the loan and retrieve the property within three days.\nIf a museum applies conservation measures to property under this section, or with the agreement of the lender, unless the agreement provides otherwise, the museum acquires a lien on the property in the amount of the costs incurred by the museum.\nThe museum is not liable for injury to or loss of the property if the museum:\n(1) had a reasonable belief at the time the action was taken that the action was necessary to protect the property on loan or other property in the custody of the museum, or that the property on loan was a hazard to the health and safety of the public or the museum staff; and\n(2) exercised reasonable care in the choice and application of conservation measures.",
