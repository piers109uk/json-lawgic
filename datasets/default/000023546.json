	"text": "(a) Pursuant to section 182.669, no meat-processing employer or other person may discharge or discriminate against a worker because the worker has raised a concern about a meatpacking operation's health and safety practices to the employer or otherwise exercised any right authorized under sections 182.65 to 182.674.\n(b) No meat-processing employer or other person may attempt to require any worker to sign a contract or other agreement that would limit or prevent the worker from disclosing information about workplace health and safety practices or hazards, or to otherwise abide by a workplace policy that would limit or prevent such disclosures. Any such agreements or policies are hereby void and unenforceable as contrary to the public policy of this state. An employer's attempt to impose such a contract, agreement, or policy shall constitute an adverse action enforceable under section 179.874.\n(c) Reporting or threatening to report a meat-processing worker's suspected citizenship or immigration status, or the suspected citizenship or immigration status of a family member of the worker, to a federal, state, or local agency because the worker exercises a right under sections 179.87 to 179.877 constitutes an adverse action for purposes of establishing a violation of that worker's rights. For purposes of this paragraph, \"family member\" means a spouse, parent, sibling, child, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin, grandparent, or grandchild related by blood, adoption, marriage, or domestic partnership.",
