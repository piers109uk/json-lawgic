	"text": "The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities and the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota may develop programs to exchange faculty between colleges or schools of education and school districts, subject to section 122A.56.\nThe programs must be used to assist in improving teacher education by involving current teachers in education courses and placing postsecondary faculty in elementary and secondary classrooms. Programs must include exchanges that extend beyond the immediate service area of the institution to address the needs of different types of schools, students, and teachers.\nState money for faculty exchange programs is to compensate for expenses that are unavoidable and beyond the normal living expenses exchange participants would incur if they were not involved in this exchange. The Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, the Board of Regents of the University of Minnesota, and their respective campuses, in conjunction with the participating school districts, must control costs for all participants as much as possible, through means such as arranging housing exchanges, providing campus housing, and providing university, state, or school district cars for transportation. The boards and campuses may seek other sources of funding to supplement these appropriations, if necessary.",
