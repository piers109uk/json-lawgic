	"text": "If, for 30 days after May 1 following service or publication, the party or parties fail to conform with the demands of the resolution authorized by section 306.21, the rights of the party or parties may be considered abandoned, and the corporation may, with the approval of its governing board, bring an action in the district court of the county against all parties in default, uniting as many parties in default as it may desire in one action, to have their rights in the lots or parcels terminated and the property restored to the corporation free of any right, title, or interest of the parties, their heirs or assigns. The action in all other respects must be brought and determined in the same manner as ordinary actions to determine title to real estate. However, that part of a tract in which a body lies buried must not be included in any of these proceedings. Sufficient ground must be left adjoining the grave or burial place to provide a proper approach. The excepted portions, if any, must be particularly and fully described.",
