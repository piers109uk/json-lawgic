	"text": "Either the client or the provider may terminate the professional relationship unless prohibited by law or court order.\nThe provider shall promptly terminate services to a client whenever:\n(1) the provider's objectivity or effectiveness is impaired, unless a resolution can be achieved as permitted in section 148F.155, subdivision 2; or\n(2) the client would be harmed by further services.\nWhen the provider initiates a termination of professional services, the provider shall inform the client either orally or in writing. This requirement shall not apply when the termination is due to the successful completion of a predefined service such as an assessment, or if the client terminates the professional relationship.\n(a) Upon termination of counseling services, the provider shall make a recommendation for alcohol and drug counseling services if requested by the client or if the provider believes the services are needed by the client.\n(b) A recommendation for alcohol and drug counseling services is not required if the professional service provided is limited to an alcohol and drug assessment and a recommendation for continued services is not requested.\nNothing in this section requires the provider to terminate a client due to an absence from practice that is the result of a period of illness or injury that does not affect the provider's ability to practice with reasonable skill and safety, as long as arrangements have been made for temporary counseling services that may be needed by the client during the provider's absence.",
