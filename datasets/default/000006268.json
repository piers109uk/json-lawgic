	"text": "If a residential mortgage originator or exempt person other than a mortgage broker does not contract or offer to contract to act as an agent of a borrower, or accept an advance fee, it must, within three business days of accepting an application for a residential mortgage loan, provide the borrower with a written disclosure as provided in subdivision 2.\nThe disclosure must be a separate document, 8-1/2 inches by 11 inches, must be signed by the borrower and must contain the following statement in 14-point boldface print:\nOriginator IS NOT ACTING AS YOUR AGENT IN CONNECTION WITH OBTAINING A RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOAN. WHILE WE SEEK TO ASSIST YOU IN MEETING YOUR FINANCIAL NEEDS, WE CANNOT GUARANTEE THE LOWEST OR BEST TERMS AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET.\nIn case of an electronic residential mortgage application, the disclosure requirements of this section may be satisfied by providing the disclosure statement as a separate screen if the disclosure must be acknowledged by the borrower before an application is accepted.\nIf the Department of Housing and Urban Development adopts and implements a disclosure requirement that the commissioner determines to be substantially similar to the disclosure required in subdivision 2, compliance with the HUD disclosure shall be considered sufficient to satisfy the requirements of subdivision 2.",
