	"text": "Inspectors appointed by the commissioner for that purpose shall make a postmortem examination and inspection of the carcasses and parts of all animals usable as human food prepared at a slaughtering, meat canning, salting, packing, rendering, or similar establishment in this state in which carcasses or parts are prepared solely for intrastate commerce. Carcasses and parts of animals found to be unadulterated must be marked, stamped, tagged, or labeled, as \"Inspected and Passed.\" The inspectors shall label, mark, stamp, or tag as \"Inspected and Condemned\" carcasses and parts of animals found to be adulterated. Carcasses and animal parts inspected and condemned must be destroyed for food purposes by the establishment in the presence of an inspector. The commissioner may remove inspectors from an establishment which fails to destroy a condemned carcass or animal part.\nAfter the first inspection, inspectors shall, if they consider it necessary, reinspect the carcasses or animal parts to determine whether they have become adulterated since the first inspection. If a carcass or animal part is then found to be adulterated, it must be destroyed for food purposes by the establishment in the presence of an inspector. The commissioner may remove inspectors from an establishment which fails to destroy a condemned carcass or animal part.",
