	"title": "593.50 PROTECTION OF JURORS' EMPLOYMENT.",
	"text": "An employer shall not deprive an employee of employment, or threaten or otherwise coerce the employee with respect to employment status, because the employee receives a summons, responds thereto, serves as a juror, or attends court for prospective jury service. An employer must release an employee from the employee's regular work schedule, including any shift work, to permit the employee to attend court for prospective jury service. An employer must not require an employee to work an alternative shift on any day the juror is required to report to the courthouse for jury service. Nothing in this section shall prevent an employee from voluntarily requesting to work an alternative work schedule on any day the juror is required to report to the courthouse for jury service, as long as the employer does not encourage, prompt, or ask for the employee to make such a request.\nAn employer who violates subdivision 1 is guilty of criminal contempt and upon conviction may be fined not more than $700 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\nIf an employer discharges an employee in violation of subdivision 1 the employee within 30 days may bring a civil action for recovery of wages lost as a result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages recoverable shall not exceed lost wages for six weeks. An employee who prevails shall be allowed a reasonable attorney's fee fixed by the court.",
