	"text": "(a) Except as provided in paragraph (e) and unless prohibited or limited by the articles or bylaws, an action that may be taken at a regular or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the corporation mails or otherwise delivers a ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. A corporation may deliver a ballot by electronic communication only if the corporation complies with section 317A.450, subdivision 5, as if the ballot were a notice. Consent by a member to receive notice by electronic communication in a certain manner constitutes consent to receive a ballot by electronic communication in the same manner.\n(b) A ballot must:\n(1) set forth each proposed action; and\n(2) provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.\n(c) Approval by ballot under this section is valid only if the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot.\n(d) Solicitations for votes by written ballot must:\n(1) indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements;\n(2) state the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and\n(3) specify the time by which a ballot must be received by the corporation in order to be counted.\n(e) Except as otherwise provided in the articles or bylaws, a ballot may not be revoked.\n(f) A ballot delivered to the corporation by electronic communication is valid only if authenticated as provided in section 317A.011, subdivision 3a.",
