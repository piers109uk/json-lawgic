	"text": "When a person charged with a criminal offense is admitted to bail or committed by the judge, the judge shall also bind by recognizance any witnesses against the accused whom the judge considers material, to appear and testify at any trial or hearing in which the accused is scheduled to appear. If the judge is satisfied that there is good reason to believe that a witness will not perform the conditions of the witness' recognizance unless other security is given, the judge may order the witness to enter into a recognizance for the witness' appearance, with sureties as the judge considers necessary. Except in case of murder in the first degree, arson where human life is destroyed, and cruel abuse of children, the judge may not commit any witness who offers to recognize, without sureties, for the witness' appearance.",
