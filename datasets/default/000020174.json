	"text": "The registration renewal cycle for registered naturopathic doctors is converted to an annual cycle where renewal is due on the last day of the registrant's month of birth. Conversion pursuant to this section begins January 1, 2020. This section governs registration renewal procedures for registrants who were registered before December 31, 2019. The conversion renewal cycle is the renewal cycle following the first registration renewal after January 1, 2020. The conversion registration period is the registration period for the conversion renewal cycle. The conversion registration period is between six and 17 months and ends the last day of the registrant's month of birth in either 2020 or 2021, as described in subdivision 2.\nFor a registrant whose registration is current as of December 31, 2019, the registrant's conversion registration period begins on January 1, 2020, and ends on the last day of the registrant's month of birth in 2020, except that for registrants whose month of birth is January, February, March, April, May, or June, the registrant's renewal cycle ends on the last day of the registrant's month of birth in 2021.\nThis subdivision applies to an individual who was registered before December 31, 2019, but whose registration is not current as of December 31, 2019. When the individual first renews the registration after January 1, 2020, the conversion renewal cycle begins on the date the individual applies for renewal and ends on the last day of the registrant's month of birth in the same year, except that if the last day of the individual's month of birth is less than six months after the date the individual applies for renewal, then the renewal period ends on the last day of the individual's month of birth in the following year.\nAfter the registrant's conversion renewal cycle under subdivision 2 or 3, subsequent renewal cycles are annual and begin on the last day of the month of the registrant's birth.\n(a) A registrant who holds a registration issued before January 1, 2020, and who renews that registration pursuant to subdivision 2 or 3, shall pay a renewal fee as required in this subdivision.\n(b) A registrant shall be charged the annual registration fee listed in section 147E.40 for the conversion registration period.\n(c) For a registrant whose conversion registration period is six to 11 months, the first annual registration fee charged after the conversion registration period shall be adjusted to credit the excess fee payment made during the conversion registration period. The credit is calculated by: (1) subtracting the number of months of the registrant's conversion registration period from 12; and (2) multiplying the result of clause (1) by 1/12 of the annual fee rounded up to the next dollar.\n(d) For a registrant whose conversion registration period is 12 months, the first annual registration fee charged after the conversion registration period shall not be adjusted.\n(e) For a registrant whose conversion registration period is 13 to 17 months, the first annual registration fee charged after the conversion registration period shall be adjusted to add the annual registration fee payment for the months that were not included in the annual registration fee paid for the conversion registration period. The added payment is calculated by: (1) subtracting 12 from the number of months of the registrant's conversion registration period; and (2) multiplying the result of clause (1) by 1/12 of the annual fee rounded up to the next dollar.\n(f) For the second and all subsequent registration renewals made after the conversion registration period, the registrant's annual registration fee is as listed in section 147E.40.\nThis section expires July 1, 2022.",
