	"text": "When an indictment is found, it shall be immediately presented by the foreperson, in the presence of the grand jury, to the court, filed with the court administrator, recorded in a book kept for that purpose as soon as the arraignment shall have been made, and remain in the court administrator's office as a public record. The court administrator shall certify at the bottom of the record that the court administrator has compared the same with the original, and that it is a true copy thereof. Such record shall have all the force and effect of the original indictment, and, in case the indictment should be lost, mislaid, or for any reason not be before the court, any proceeding may be had upon such record in the same manner and with the same effect as if the original was before the court, and in such case no trial, conviction, or sentence shall be invalid by reason of the fact that the original indictment has disappeared from the files of the court after the recording thereof.",
