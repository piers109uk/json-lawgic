The process for the submission of payments and for the submission of requests may be established by the director. Upon approval of the request for payment by the office, payments shall be made directly to designated shelter facilities from grant funds on behalf of women and their children who reside in the shelter facility. Payments made to a designated shelter facility must not exceed the grant amount for that facility unless approved by the director. These payments must not affect the eligibility of individuals who reside in shelter facilities for public assistance benefits, except when required by federal law or regulation.\nThe office shall calculate the grant amount for each designated shelter facility. This calculation may be based upon program type, average occupancy rates, and licensed capacity limits. The total of all grant amounts shall not exceed the legislative appropriation.\nShelter facilities must comply with reporting requirements and any other measures imposed by the Office of Justice Programs in the Department of Public Safety to improve accountability and program outcomes including, but not limited to, information on all restricted or unrestricted fund balances.",
