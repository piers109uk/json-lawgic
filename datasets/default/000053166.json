	"text": "If a witness is required to recognize, with or without sureties, and refuses to do so, the judge shall commit that witness until the witness complies with the order, or is otherwise discharged according to law. During confinement a person held as a witness must receive the compensation the court before whom the case is pending directs, not exceeding regular witness fees in criminal cases as provided in section 357.24. When a minor is a material witness, any other person may recognize for the appearance of the minor as a witness, or the judge may take recognizance of the minor as a witness in a sum of not more than $50. The recognizance is valid and binding in law notwithstanding the disability of the minor.",
