	"text": "The legislature finds that a process is needed to enable school boards and communities to decide matters related to planning, providing, and improving education instruction and curriculum in the context of the state's high school graduation standards. The process should help districts evaluate the impact of instruction and curriculum on students' abilities to meet graduation standards, use evaluation results to improve instruction and curriculum, and determine services that districts and other public education entities can provide collaboratively with institutions including families and private or public organizations and agencies. The legislature anticipates that a highly focused public education strategy will be an integral part of each district's review and improvement of instruction and curriculum.",
