	"text": "(a) The commissioner may have surveys made to determine the correct boundaries or description of the land or to dispose of it in convenient parcels. When the commissioner determines that the interest of the state will be promoted, the commissioner may subdivide land controlled by the commissioner into smaller parcels or city lots.\n(b) When the commissioner believes that an injustice has been done the purchaser because of an incorrect United States survey, the commissioner may have a resurvey made by a competent surveyor. The surveyor shall prepare a plat showing the correct acreage of each subdivision resurveyed and file it with the commissioner and with the county recorder of the proper county. The commissioner may call in the land certificates affected by the resurvey and issue new ones. The certificates must show the correct acreage and give full credit for all payments of principal and interest made.",
