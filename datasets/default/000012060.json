	"text": "Each statutory or home rule charter city, town, or county that has planning and zoning authority under Minnesota Statutes 2020, sections 366.10 to 366.181, or sections 394.21 to 394.37, or 462.351 to 462.365 is encouraged to adopt a soil loss ordinance. The soil loss ordinance must use the soil loss tolerance for each soil series described in the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service Field Office Technical Guide, or another method approved by the Board of Water and Soil Resources, to determine the soil loss limits, but the soil loss limits must be attainable by the best practicable soil conservation practice. Ordinances adopted by local governments must be consistent with a comprehensive plan, local water management plan, or watershed management plan developed or amended, adopted, and approved according to chapter 103B, 103C, or 103D.\nA local government that adopts a soil loss ordinance may enter an agreement with its agent allowing the agent to administer the functions and perform the duties of the local government as provided by sections 103F.401 to 103F.455.",
