	"text": "Except as otherwise provided in sections 87A.01 to 87A.08, a shooting range that is in compliance with shooting range performance standards and the requirements of sections 87A.01 to 87A.08 shall not be forced to permanently close or permanently cease any activity related to the primary use of the shooting range unless the range or activity is found to be a clear and immediate safety hazard by a court of competent jurisdiction. In any action brought to compel the permanent closure of any range in compliance with shooting range performance standards and this chapter, or to permanently cease any activity related to the primary use of the shooting range, there is a rebuttable presumption that the range or activity is not a clear and immediate safety hazard. If the shooting range provides evidence that the cause of a proven safety hazard can be mitigated so as to eliminate the safety hazard, the court shall not order the permanent closure of the range, or permanent ceasing of the activity found to be a clear and immediate safety hazard, unless the range operator fails to implement the necessary mitigation to remove the safety hazard by the date that is determined reasonable by the court.\nNothing in this section prohibits a court from granting a preliminary injunction against any activity determined to be a probable clear and immediate safety hazard, or against any individual determined to be the probable cause of an alleged clear and immediate safety hazard, pending the final determination of the existence of the safety hazard.\nA court may grant a permanent injunction only against a particular activity or person instead of permanently closing the range unless the court finds that the remaining operations also pose a safety hazard under this section.",
