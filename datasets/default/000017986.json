The amount of reimbursement is the difference between the amount received and the amount of actual entitlement as calculated by the office after it makes its final findings under section 136A.121 and rules implemented under that section. The amount of reimbursement may include any costs or expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the agency in collecting the debt. The reimbursement is recoverable from the recipient or the recipient's estate. The agency may institute a civil action, if necessary for recovery.\n(b) The recipient must not receive additional awards until the overpayment is recovered or the recipient is making payments under an approved plan. Additional awards for which the recipient is eligible may be used to recover an unreimbursed overpayment.",
