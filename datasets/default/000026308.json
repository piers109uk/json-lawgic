	"text": "Beginning January 1, 2009, a manufacturer selling or offering for sale a new motor vehicle in this state containing a mobile air conditioner that uses the high-GWP greenhouse gas HFC-134a (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane) as a refrigerant must, 90 days prior to the initial sale or offer for sale, report to the commissioner the leakage rate, in grams of refrigerant per year, for the type of mobile air conditioner contained in that make, model, and model year. The leakage rate must be calculated using the information provided in the most recently published version of the SAE International document J2727, \"HFC-134a Mobile Air Conditioning System Emission Chart.\" The method by which the leakage rate is calculated, accounting for each component of the air conditioning unit, must also be reported to the commissioner.\nBeginning January 1, 2009, the agency and the Office of the Attorney General must post on their websites:\n(1) the leakage rate disclosed by a manufacturer under subdivision 1 for each model and make of new motor vehicle sold or offered for sale in this state; and\n(2) the following statement: \"Vehicle air conditioning systems may leak refrigerants.
