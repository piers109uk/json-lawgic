	"text": "(a) Nothing in this chapter prohibits enforcement of any federal law. To the extent consistent with this chapter, other state laws regarding the health, safety, and welfare of the public may be enforced. To the extent consistent with this chapter, a local unit of government with zoning authority jurisdiction over a shooting range may enforce its applicable ordinances and permits. Nothing in this chapter shall supersede more restrictive regulation of days and hours of operation imposed by the terms and conditions of ordinances and permits that are in effect on May 28, 2005.\n(b) If the operator of the shooting range shows evidence that the range can be brought into compliance with the applicable state law, local ordinance, or permit, the range may not be permanently closed unless the range operator fails to bring the range into compliance with the applicable law, ordinance, or permit under this section by the date that the court determines reasonable. Nothing in this section prohibits a court from granting a preliminary injunction against any activity determined to be a violation of a law, ordinance, or permit under this section or against any individual determined to be causing an alleged violation, pending the final determination of the existence of the violation.\nA court may grant a permanent injunction only against a particular activity or person instead of permanently closing the range unless the court finds that the remaining operations also create a violation under this section.",
