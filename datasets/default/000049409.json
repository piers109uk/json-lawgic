	"text": "A certified copy of any decree of distribution may be filed for record in the office of the county recorder of any county. It shall not be necessary to pay real estate taxes in order to record such certified copy, but the same shall be first presented to the county auditor for entry upon the transfer record and shall have noted thereon \"Transfer entered\" over that person's official signature. Upon request, the court shall furnish a certified copy of any decree of distribution, omitting the description of any property except that specified in the request, but indicating omissions by the words \"other property omitted.\" Such copy and its record shall have the same force and effect as to property therein described as though the entire decree had been so certified and recorded.",
