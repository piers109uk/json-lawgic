A society may provide benefits on the lives of children under the minimum age for adult membership upon application of an adult person.\nSubdivision 1, clauses (1) to (6), continues the benefit authority provided in Minnesota Statutes 1984, chapter 64A. Subdivision 1, clause (7), provides that the current parity between the types of products that fraternals and other life insurers can provide be maintained in the future. Under this provision, any new product authorities granted to life insurers will also be available to fraternals if the new products are not inconsistent with fraternal code provisions, such as membership, and representative forms of government.",
