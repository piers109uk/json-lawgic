The commissioner of human services may extend the length of assistance on a case-by-case basis.\nHousing assistance under this section is available only to persons of low or moderate income as determined by the commissioner.\nThe commissioner may contract with organizations or government units experienced in housing assistance to operate the program under this section. This program is not an entitlement. The commissioner may take any of the following steps whenever the commissioner projects that funds will be inadequate to meet demand in a given fiscal year:\n(1) transfer funds from mental health grants in the same appropriation; and\n(2) impose statewide restrictions as to the type and amount of assistance available to each recipient under this program, including reducing the income eligibility level, limiting reimbursement to a percentage of each recipient's costs, limiting housing assistance to 60 days per recipient, or closing the program for the remainder of the fiscal year.",
