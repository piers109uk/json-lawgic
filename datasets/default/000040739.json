	"text": "(a) Upon adoption of the next annual budget following the creation of a subordinate service district the town board shall include in the budget appropriate provisions for the operation of the district including either a property tax levied only on property of the users of the service within the boundaries of the district or a levy of a service charge against the users of the service within the district, or a combination of a property tax and a service charge on the users of the service.\n(b) A tax or service charge or a combination of them may be imposed to finance a function or service in the district that the town ordinarily provides throughout the town only to the extent that there is an increase in the level of the function or service provided in the service district over that provided throughout the town. In that case, in addition to the townwide tax levy, an amount necessary to pay for the increase in the level of the function or service may be imposed in the district.\nAt any time after the requirements of section 365A.06 have been met and the subordinate service district created, the town board may issue obligations in an amount it deems necessary to defray in whole or in part the expense incurred and estimated to be incurred in making capital improvements necessary to operate the subordinate service district and provide the special services in the district, including every item of cost from inception to completion and all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the capital improvements or the financing. The obligations are payable primarily out of the proceeds of the taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net revenues as described in section 444.075, and special assessments under chapter 429. The town board may by resolution pledge the full faith credit and taxing power of the town to ensure payment of the principal and interest on the obligations if the proceeds of the taxes and service charges are insufficient to pay the principal and interest. Obligations must be issued in accordance with chapter 475, except that an election is not required, and the amount of the obligations is not included in determining the net indebtedness of the town under the provisions of any law limiting indebtedness.\nIn resolutions authorizing the issuance of general or special obligations and pledging taxes and service charges imposed under subdivision 1, net revenues, or special assessments to their payment, the town board may make covenants for the protection of holders of the obligations and taxpayers of the town as it deems necessary, including a covenant that the town will impose and collect charges of the nature authorized by this chapter at the time and in the amounts required to produce, together with any taxes or special assessments designated as a primary source of payment of the obligations, funds adequate to pay all principal and interest when due on the obligations, and to create and maintain reserves securing the payments as may be provided in the resolutions.",
