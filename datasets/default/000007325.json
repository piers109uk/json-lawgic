	"text": "(a) For purposes of this section, \"Medicare supplement policy or certificate\" has the meaning given in section 62A.3099 but also includes a policy, contract, or certificate issued under a contract under section 1833 or 1876 of the federal Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section 1395 et seq. A Medicare supplement policy form or certificate form shall not be delivered or issued for delivery unless the policy form or certificate form can be expected, as estimated for the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage, to return to policyholders and certificate holders in the form of aggregate benefits, not including anticipated refunds or credits, provided under the policy form or certificate form:\n(1) at least 75 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums earned in the case of group policies; and\n(2) at least 65 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums earned in the case of individual policies.\nThese ratios must be calculated based upon incurred claims experience, or incurred health care expenses where coverage is provided by a health maintenance organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis, and earned premiums for the period and according to accepted actuarial principles and practices. For purposes of this calculation, \"health care expenses\" has the meaning given in section 62A.3099, subdivision 10. An insurer shall demonstrate that the third year loss ratio is greater than or equal to the applicable percentage.\nAll filings of rates and rating schedules shall demonstrate that expected claims in relation to premiums comply with the requirements of this section when combined with actual experience to date. Filings of rate revisions shall also demonstrate that the anticipated loss ratio over the entire future period for which the revised rates are computed to provide coverage can be expected to meet the appropriate loss ratio standards, and aggregate loss ratio from inception of the policy or certificate shall equal or exceed the appropriate loss ratio standards.\nAn application form for a Medicare supplement policy or certificate, as defined in this section, must prominently disclose the anticipated loss ratio and explain what it means.\n(b) An issuer shall collect and file with the commissioner by May 31 of each year the data contained in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Medicare Supplement Refund Calculating form, for each type of Medicare supplement benefit plan.\nIf, on the basis of the experience as reported, the benchmark ratio since inception (ratio 1) exceeds the adjusted experience ratio since inception (ratio 3), then a refund or credit calculation is required. The refund calculation must be done on a statewide basis for each type in a standard Medicare supplement benefit plan. For purposes of the refund or credit calculation, experience on policies issued within the reporting year shall be excluded.\nA refund or credit shall be made only when the benchmark loss ratio exceeds the adjusted experience loss ratio and the amount to be refunded or credited exceeds a de minimis level. The refund shall include interest from the end of the calendar year to the date of the refund or credit at a rate specified by the secretary of health and human services, but in no event shall it be less than the average rate of interest for 13-week treasury bills. A refund or credit against premiums due shall be made by September 30 following the experience year on which the refund or credit is based.\n(c) An issuer of Medicare supplement policies and certificates in this state shall file annually its rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation including ratios of incurred losses to earned premiums by policy or certificate duration for approval by the commissioner according to the filing requirements and procedures prescribed by the commissioner. The supporting documentation shall also demonstrate in accordance with actuarial standards of practice using reasonable assumptions that the appropriate loss ratio standards can be expected to be met over the entire period for which rates are computed. The demonstration shall exclude active life reserves. An expected third-year loss ratio which is greater than or equal to the applicable percentage shall be demonstrated for policies or certificates in force less than three years.\nAs soon as practicable, but before the effective date of enhancements in Medicare benefits, every issuer of Medicare supplement policies or certificates in this state shall file with the commissioner, in accordance with the applicable filing procedures of this state:\n(1) a premium adjustment that is necessary to produce an expected loss ratio under the policy or certificate that will conform with minimum loss ratio standards for Medicare supplement policies or certificates. No premium adjustment that would modify the loss ratio experience under the policy or certificate other than the adjustments described herein shall be made with respect to a policy or certificate at any time other than on its renewal date or anniversary date;\n(2) if an issuer fails to make premium adjustments acceptable to the commissioner, the commissioner may order premium adjustments, refunds, or premium credits considered necessary to achieve the loss ratio required by this section;\n(3) any appropriate riders, endorsements, or policy or certificate forms needed to accomplish the Medicare supplement insurance policy or certificate modifications necessary to eliminate benefit duplications with Medicare. The riders, endorsements, or policy or certificate forms shall provide a clear description of the Medicare supplement benefits provided by the policy or certificate.\n(d) The commissioner may conduct a public hearing to gather information concerning a request by an issuer for an increase in a rate for a policy form or certificate form if the experience of the form for the previous reporting period is not in compliance with the applicable loss ratio standard. The determination of compliance is made without consideration of a refund or credit for the reporting period. Public notice of the hearing shall be furnished in a manner considered appropriate by the commissioner.\n(e) An issuer shall not use or change premium rates for a Medicare supplement policy or certificate unless the rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation have been filed with, and approved by, the commissioner according to the filing requirements and procedures prescribed by the commissioner.\n(f) An issuer must file any riders or amendments to policy or certificate forms to delete outpatient prescription drug benefits as required by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 only with the commissioner in the state in which the policy or certificate was issued.\n(g) Issuers are permitted to continue to issue currently approved policy and certificate forms as appropriate through December 31, 2005.\n(h) Issuers must comply with any requirements to notify enrollees under the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003.\nEach insurer that has Medicare supplement policies in force in this state shall, as a supplement to the annual statement required by section 60A.13, submit, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, data showing its incurred claims experience, its earned premiums, and the aggregate amount of premiums collected and losses incurred for each Medicare policy form in force. If the data submitted does not confirm that the insurer has satisfied the loss ratio requirements of this section, the commissioner shall notify the insurer in writing of the deficiency. The insurer shall have 30 days from the date of the commissioner's notice to file amended rates that comply with this section. If the insurer fails to file amended rates within the prescribed time, the commissioner shall order that the insurer's filed rates for the nonconforming policy be reduced to an amount that would have resulted in a loss ratio that complied with this section had it been in effect for the reporting period of the supplement. The insurer's failure to file amended rates within the specified time or the issuance of the commissioner's order amending the rates does not preclude the insurer from filing an amendment of its rates at a later time. The commissioner shall annually make the submitted data as to premiums and loss ratios for the preceding three years available to the public at a cost not to exceed the cost of copying. The commissioner shall also provide the public with copies of the policies to which the loss ratios and premiums apply. The data must be compiled in a form useful for consumers who wish to compare premium charges and loss ratios.\nEach sale of a policy that does not comply with the loss ratio requirements of this section is an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance and is subject to the penalties in sections 72A.17 to 72A.32.\nFor purposes of this section, Medicare supplement policies issued as a result of solicitations of individuals through the mail or mass media advertising, including both print and broadcast advertising, shall be treated as individual policies.",
