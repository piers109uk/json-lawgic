	"text": "This section applies to a primary, special, or general election held in a city that is not held in conjunction with a state or federal election, and to town elections when postponement of the town election is not subject to section 365.51.\n(a) In the event of severe or inclement weather, the municipal clerk may postpone an election when the National Weather Service or a law enforcement agency has issued storm warnings or travel advisories indicating that the weather conditions would make travel to a polling place difficult or hazardous for voters and election judges. When one or more jurisdictions are holding elections in conjunction with one another, the jurisdiction that covers the largest geographic area has the authority, after consulting with the other auditors and clerks, to make the decision to postpone all of the elections. A decision to postpone an election must apply to every precinct in the jurisdiction.\n(b) A decision to postpone an election must be made no later than 6:00 p.m. on the day before the election. The clerk must contact the election judges and notify local media outlets of the postponement. The clerk must also post a notice on the jurisdiction's website, if practicable.\n(c) A postponed election must be rescheduled for the next following Tuesday after the election was originally scheduled. The date on which the postponed election will be held shall be considered the date of the election for purposes of absentee voting under chapter 203B. An election that is postponed due to weather may be postponed again if necessary under this section.",
