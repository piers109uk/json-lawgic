	"text": "(a) For all contracts for goods and services in excess of $100,000, neither the council nor an agency listed in section 473.143, subdivision 1, shall accept any bid or proposal for a contract or agreement from any business having more than 40 full-time employees within this state on a single working day during the previous 12 months, unless the firm or business has an affirmative action plan for the employment of minority persons, women, and qualified disabled individuals submitted to the commissioner of human rights for approval. Neither the council nor an agency listed in section 473.143, subdivision 1, shall execute the contract or agreement until the affirmative action plan has been approved by the commissioner of human rights. Receipt of a certificate of compliance from the commissioner of human rights signifies that a business has an approved affirmative action plan. A certificate is valid for two years. Section 363A.36 governs revocation of certificates. The rules adopted by the commissioner of human rights under section 363A.37 apply to this section.\n(b) This paragraph applies to a contract for goods or services in excess of $100,000 to be entered into between the council or an agency listed in section 473.143, subdivision 1, and a business that is not subject to paragraph (a), but that has more than 40 full-time employees on a single working day during the previous 12 months in the state where the business has its primary place of business. The council or the agency may not execute a contract or agreement with a business covered by this paragraph unless the business has a certificate of compliance issued by the commissioner under paragraph (a) or the business certifies to the contracting agency that it is in compliance with federal affirmative action requirements.",
