	"title": "62A.141 COVERAGE FOR DISABLED DEPENDENTS.",
	"text": "No group policy or group plan of health and accident insurance regulated under this chapter, chapter 62C, or 62D, which provides for dependent coverage may be issued or renewed in this state after August 1, 1983, unless it covers the disabled dependents of the insured, subscriber, or enrollee of the policy or plan. For purposes of this section, a disabled dependent is a person that is and continues to be both: (1) incapable of self-sustaining employment by reason of developmental disability, mental illness or disorder, or physical disability; and (2) chiefly dependent upon the policyholder for support and maintenance. Consequently, the policy or plan shall not contain any provision concerning preexisting condition limitations, insurability, eligibility, or health underwriting approval concerning disabled dependents.\nIf ordered by the commissioner of commerce, the insurer of a Minnesota-domiciled nonprofit association which is composed solely of agricultural members may restrict coverage under this section to apply only to Minnesota residents.",
