Such amount shall be in addition to the contingent fund of such county now allowed by law and shall be disbursed only on order of a district judge of the district in which any such county is located, approving such expenditure.\nThe county board, if no funds are available, may borrow such money as it deems necessary to carry out the provisions of this section, but such loan shall not run over one year.",
