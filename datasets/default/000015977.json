	"text": "A district must flag the record of a pupil who is currently or was previously enrolled in the district if a law enforcement agency notifies the district of the pupil's disappearance. The flag must be made so that, if a copy of or information regarding the pupil's record is requested, the district is aware that the record is that of a missing pupil.\nWhen the district provides a copy of the pupil's record or other information concerning the pupil whose record is flagged, the district must notify the law enforcement agency that notified the district of the pupil's disappearance of every inquiry concerning the record. The district must also provide a copy to the law enforcement agency of a written request for information concerning the record.\nWhen a pupil transfers from one district to another, the receiving district shall attempt to obtain, within 30 days of the pupil's enrollment, the pupil's record from the district from which the pupil has transferred. If the pupil's parent, custodian, or guardian provides a copy of the pupil's record from the district from which the pupil has transferred, the receiving district must request, within 30 days of the pupil's enrollment, written verification of the pupil's record by contacting the district named on the transferring pupil's record. Information received by a district indicating that the transferring pupil is a missing child must be reported by the district to the department of public safety.\nData in this section may be disclosed according to section 13.32, subdivision 3, clause (d).",
