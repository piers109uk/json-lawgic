The commissioner, upon written request, may issue separate checks, to the spouses for one-half of the relief provided the original check has not been issued or has been returned. Individuals related as spouses who were married during the year may elect to file a joint claim which shall include each spouse's income and property taxes payable. Spouses who were married for the entire year and were domiciled in the same household for the entire year must file a joint claim. The maximum dollar amount allowable for a joint claim shall not exceed the amount that one person could receive.",
