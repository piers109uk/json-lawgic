	"text": "No policy of accident and sickness insurance or group subscriber contract regulated under chapter 62C issued or renewed in this state may contain a provision that makes an insured person ineligible to receive full benefits because of the insured's failure to obtain preauthorization, if that failure occurs because of the need for emergency confinement or emergency treatment. The insured or an authorized representative of the insured shall notify the insurer as soon after the beginning of emergency confinement or emergency treatment as reasonably possible. However, to the extent that the insurer suffers actual prejudice caused by the failure to obtain preauthorization, the insured may be denied all or part of the insured's benefits.",
