On August 1, and on the first day of each succeeding calendar month, an additional five percent penalty is imposed if the report has not yet been filed. For each airline company, the penalties imposed under this subdivision for any one year are limited to the lesser of $25,000 or 25 percent of the assessed tax.\nIf there is a pattern of repeated failures by an airline company to timely file the report required by this section, a penalty of ten percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company.\nIf an airline company files a frivolous annual report, a penalty of 25 percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company. A frivolous report under this section is a report that would fulfill the criteria for a frivolous return under section 289A.60, subdivision 7, notwithstanding the restriction in section 289A.01. In a proceeding involving the issue of whether or not an airline company is liable for this penalty, the burden of proof is on the commissioner.\nIf an airline company files a false or fraudulent annual report with intent to evade or defeat the tax, a penalty equal to 50 percent of the tax being assessed is imposed on that company.\nPenalties imposed under this section are added to the tax and collected as a part of it.",
