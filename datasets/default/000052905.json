	"text": "Whenever it appears that a person is engaged or is about to engage in an act that constitutes or will constitute a felony violation of this chapter, the attorney general or a county attorney may initiate a civil action in district court to enjoin the violation. The court shall proceed as soon as practicable to the hearing and determination of the civil action, and may, at any time before final determination, enter a restraining order or prohibition, or take other action, as is warranted to prevent a continuing and substantial injury to the state, any of its subdivisions, or to a person or class of persons for whose protection the action is brought. A proceeding under this section is governed by the Rules of Civil Procedure, except that, if the defendant has been charged with the felony, discovery against that defendant is governed by the Rules of Criminal Procedure.",
