	"text": "The Interstate Medical Licensure Compact is enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining in it, in the form substantially as follows:\nARTICLE 1\nPURPOSE\nIn order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards, and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the compact.\nARTICLE 2\nDEFINITIONS\n(a) \"Bylaws\" means those bylaws established by the Interstate Commission pursuant to article 11 for its governance, or for directing and controlling its actions and conduct.\n(b) \"Commissioner\" means the voting representative appointed by each member board pursuant to article 11.\n(c) \"Conviction\" means a finding by a court that an individual is guilty of a criminal offense through adjudication, or entry of a plea of guilt or no contest to the charge by the offender.

The executive committee shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission, with the exception of rulemaking, during periods when the Interstate Commission is not in session. When acting on behalf of the Interstate Commission, the executive committee shall oversee the administration of the compact, including enforcement and compliance with the provisions of the compact, its bylaws and rules, and other such duties as necessary.\n(l) The Interstate Commission may establish other committees for governance and administration of the compact.\nARTICLE 12\nPOWERS AND DUTIES OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\nThe Interstate Commission shall have the duty and power to:\n(1) oversee and maintain the administration of the compact;\n(2) promulgate rules which shall be binding to the extent and in the manner provided for in the compact;\n(3) issue, upon the request of a member state or member board, advisory opinions concerning the meaning or interpretation of the compact and its bylaws, rules, and actions;\n(4) enforce compliance with compact provisions, the rules promulgated by the Interstate Commission, and the bylaws, using all necessary and proper means, including, but not limited to, the use of judicial process;\n(5) establish and appoint committees, including, but not limited to, an executive committee as required by article 11, which shall have the power to act on behalf of the Interstate Commission in carrying out its powers and duties;\n(6) pay or provide for the payment of the expenses related to the establishment, organization, and ongoing activities of the Interstate Commission;\n(7) establish and maintain one or more offices;\n(8) borrow, accept, hire, or contract for services of personnel;\n(9) purchase and maintain insurance and bonds;\n(10) employ an executive director who shall employ, select or appoint employees, agents, or consultants, and determine their qualifications, define their duties, and fix their compensation;\n(11) establish personnel policies and programs relating to conflicts of interest, rates of compensation, and qualifications of personnel;\n(12) accept donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, and to receive, utilize, and dispose of them in a manner consistent with the conflict of interest policies established by the Interstate Commission;\n(13) lease, purchase, accept contributions or donations of, or otherwise to own, hold, improve, or use any property, real, personal, or mixed;\n(14) sell, convey, mortgage, pledge, lease, exchange, abandon, or otherwise dispose of any property, real, personal, or mixed;\n(15) establish a budget and make expenditures;\n(16) adopt a seal and bylaws governing the management and operation of the Interstate Commission;\n(17) report annually to the legislatures and governors of the member states concerning the activities of the Interstate Commission during the preceding year.

The Interstate Commission is considered to be an instrumentality of the states for the purposes of any such action. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to protect such person from suit or liability for damage, loss, injury, or liability caused by the intentional or willful and wanton misconduct of the person.\n(f) The Interstate Commission shall defend the executive director and its employees, and, subject to the approval of the attorney general or other appropriate legal counsel of the member state represented by an Interstate Commission representative, shall defend the Interstate Commission representative in any civil action seeking to impose liability arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that the defendant had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of the person.\n(g) To the extent not covered by the state involved, member state, or the Interstate Commission, the representatives or employees of the Interstate Commission shall be held harmless in the amount of a settlement or judgment, including attorney fees and costs, obtained against such persons arising out of an actual or alleged act, error, or omission that occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, or that such persons had a reasonable basis for believing occurred within the scope of Interstate Commission employment, duties, or responsibilities, provided that the actual or alleged act, error, or omission did not result from intentional or willful and wanton misconduct on the part of such persons.\nARTICLE 15\nRULEMAKING FUNCTIONS OF THE INTERSTATE COMMISSION\n(a) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of the compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of the compact, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.\n(b) Rules deemed appropriate for the operations of the Interstate Commission shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the Model State Administrative Procedure Act of 2010, and subsequent amendments thereto.\n(c) Not later than 30 days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, provided that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the authority granted to the Interstate Commission.\nARTICLE 16\nOVERSIGHT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT\n(a) The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce the compact and shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The provisions of the compact and the rules promulgated hereunder shall have standing as statutory law, but shall not override existing state authority to regulate the practice of medicine.\n(b) All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact that may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.\n(c) The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, the compact, or promulgated rules.\nARTICLE 17\nENFORCEMENT OF INTERSTATE COMPACT\n(a) The Interstate Commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of the compact.\n(b) The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the commissioners, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices, to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, and its promulgated rules and bylaws, against a member state in default. The relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\n(c) The remedies herein shall not be the exclusive remedies of the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission may avail itself of any other remedies available under state law or the regulation of a profession.\nARTICLE 18\nDEFAULT PROCEDURES\n(a) The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a member state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by the compact, or the rules and bylaws of the Interstate Commission promulgated under the compact.\n(b) If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:\n(1) provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default; and\n(2) provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.\n(c) If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the commissioners, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by the compact shall terminate on the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.\n(d) Termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.\n(e) The Interstate Commission shall establish rules and procedures to address licenses and physicians that are materially impacted by the termination of a member state or the withdrawal of a member state.\n(f) The member state that has been terminated is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.\n(g) The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.\n(h) The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.\nARTICLE 19\nDISPUTE RESOLUTION\n(a) The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes that are subject to the compact and that may arise among member states or member boards.\n(b) The Interstate Commission shall promulgate rules providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution as appropriate.\nARTICLE 20\nMEMBER STATES, EFFECTIVE DATE, AND AMENDMENT\n(a) Any state is eligible to become a member state of the compact.\n(b) The compact shall become effective and binding upon legislative enactment of the compact into law by no less than seven states. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding on a state upon enactment of the compact into law by that state.\n(c) The governors of nonmember states, or their designees, shall be invited to participate in the activities of the Interstate Commission on a nonvoting basis prior to adoption of the compact by all states.\n(d) The Interstate Commission may propose amendments to the compact for enactment by the member states. No amendment shall become effective and binding upon the Interstate Commission and the member states unless and until it is enacted into law by unanimous consent of the member states.\nARTICLE 21\nWITHDRAWAL\n(a) Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every member state, provided that a member state may withdraw from the compact by specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.\n(b) Withdrawal from the compact shall be by the enactment of a statute repealing the same, but shall not take effect until one year after the effective date of such statute and until written notice of the withdrawal has been given by the withdrawing state to the governor of each other member state.\n(c) The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state.\n(d) The Interstate Commission shall notify the other member states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt of notice provided under paragraph (c).\n(e) The withdrawing state is responsible for all dues, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including obligations, and the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal.\n(f) Reinstatement following withdrawal of a member state shall occur upon the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or upon such later date as determined by the Interstate Commission.\n(g) The Interstate Commission is authorized to develop rules to address the impact of the withdrawal of a member state on licenses granted in other member states to physicians who designated the withdrawing member state as the state of principal license.\nARTICLE 22\nDISSOLUTION\n(a) The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of a member state that reduces the membership in the compact to one member state.\n(b) Upon the dissolution of the compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be concluded and surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.\nARTICLE 23\nSEVERABILITY AND CONSTRUCTION\n(a) The provisions of the compact shall be severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision is deemed unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the compact shall be enforceable.\n(b) The provisions of the compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\n(c) Nothing in the compact shall be construed to prohibit the applicability of other interstate compacts to which the states are members.\nARTICLE 24\nBINDING EFFECT OF COMPACT AND OTHER LAWS\n(a) Nothing herein prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state that is not inconsistent with the compact.\n(b) All laws in a member state in conflict with the compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict.\n(c) All lawful actions of the Interstate Commission, including all rules and bylaws promulgated by the commission, are binding upon the member states.\n(d) All agreements between the Interstate Commission and the member states are binding in accordance with their terms.\n(e) In the event any provision of the compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any member state, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of the conflict with the constitutional provision in question in that member state.",
