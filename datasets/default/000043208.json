	"text": "During proceedings for improvements under this chapter or within 90 days after the final order of the court on the last appeal from those proceedings, the city council may set aside awards and abandon proceedings concerning parcels if it thinks that is in the city's interest. The city council may also rescind and annul a pedestrian mall ordinance adopted after being proposed under section 430.011 within 90 days after the final order of the court on the last appeal from those proceedings under section 430.03 or 430.031. If it does, any improvement begun in connection with the ordinance is abandoned and any awards and assessments are set aside. Awards, if not set aside, are a charge upon the city, for the payment of which the city pledges its faith and credit, and the city is entitled to immediate possession. The city council may order awards that are not set aside to be paid into the district court of the county for the use and benefit of those who are entitled to them. The money paid into court must be paid out under order of the court upon application of interested parties after notice required by the court.",
