	"title": "79A.08 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.",
	"text": "It is the intent of the legislature in enacting sections 79A.08 to 79A.10 to provide for the continuation of workers' compensation benefits delayed due to the failure of a private self-insured employer to meet its compensation obligations, whenever the commissioner of commerce issues a certificate of default or there is a declaration of insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. With respect to the continued liability of a surety for claims that arise under a bond after termination of that bond and to a surety's liability for the cost of administration of claims, it is the intent of the legislature to provide that that liability ceases upon lawful termination of that bond. This applies to all surety bonds which are purchased by the self-insured employer after July 1, 1988. The legislature finds and declares that the establishment of the self-insurers' security fund is a necessary component of a complete system of workers' compensation, required by chapter 176, to have adequate provisions for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of any and all workers and their dependents to the extent of relieving the consequences of any industrial injury or death, and full provision for securing the payment of compensation.",
