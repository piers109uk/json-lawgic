	"text": "When personal property of a decedent has come into the custody of any coroner and has not been surrendered as hereinafter provided and no will has been admitted to probate or no administration has been had within three months after the decedent's death, the coroner, after the expiration of said time, shall file in the court an inventory of all such property and a fingerprint of each finger of each hand of the decedent. Wearing apparel and such other property as the coroner determines to be of nominal value, may be surrendered by the coroner to the spouse or to any blood relative of the decedent. If no will is admitted to probate nor administration had within six months after death, the coroner shall sell the same at public auction upon such notice and in such manner as the court may direct. The coroner shall be allowed reasonable expenses for the care and sale of the property, and shall deposit the net proceeds of such sale with the county treasurer in the name of the decedent, if known. The treasurer shall give the coroner duplicate receipts therefor, one of which the coroner shall file with the county auditor and the other in the court. If a representative shall qualify within six years from the time of such deposit, the treasurer shall pay the same to such representative.",
