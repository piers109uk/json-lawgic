The indemnity provided in this section may not be disclaimed or contractually limited in scope. However, a contract may provide consistent, additional terms regarding the indemnification.\nIn obtaining information of the subscriber material to issuance of a certificate, the certification authority may require the subscriber to certify the accuracy of relevant information under oath or affirmation of truthfulness and under penalty of perjury.",
