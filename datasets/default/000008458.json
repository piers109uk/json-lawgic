Flood insurance is available to communities and property that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (\"NFIP\"). Not all communities participate in the NFIP. Flood insurance may be available even if you do not live in a flood hazard area as defined by the NFIP. If your community does not participate in the NFIP, you may contact your insurance agent or broker to see if there is other flood insurance coverage available to you.\"\nThe disclosure may also inform the policyholders that the insurer offers flood insurance as a participant in the NFIP's \"Write Your Own\" program.",
