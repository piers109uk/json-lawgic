	"text": "A local road authority may provide by ordinance for the designation of pedestrian safety crossings on highways under the road authority's jurisdiction where pedestrian safety considerations require extra time for pedestrian crossing in addition to the time recommended under the Minnesota Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for pedestrian signals. The ordinance may provide for timing of pedestrian signals for such crossings, consistent with the recommendations of the uniform manual for pedestrian signal timing at senior citizen and disabled pedestrian crossings. Cities other than cities of the first class may designate a pedestrian safety crossing only with the approval of the road authority having jurisdiction over the crossing. The authority of local road authorities to determine pedestrian signal timing under this section is in addition to any other control exercised by local road authorities over the timing of pedestrian signals.",
