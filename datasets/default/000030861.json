The notification must include a description of the runaway's physical and emotional condition and the circumstances surrounding the runaway's admission to the emergency shelter, unless there are compelling reasons not to provide the parent or legal guardian with this information. Compelling reasons may include circumstances in which the runaway is or has been exposed to domestic violence or a victim of abuse, neglect, or abandonment.",
