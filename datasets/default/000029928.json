	"text": "For purposes of establishing financial responsibility, residence must be determined as of the date a local agency receives a signed request or signed application or the date of eligibility, whichever is later. This subdivision extends to cases in which the applicant may move to another county after the date of application but before the grant or service is actually approved.\n(a) A person retains county and state residence so long as the person's absence from Minnesota is viewed as a temporary absence within the context of the affected program.\n(b) Direct entry into a facility in another state does not end Minnesota residence for purposes of this chapter. Financial responsibility does not continue, however, unless placement was initiated by a human service or direct care and treatment agency or another governmental entity that has statutory authority to bind the human service or direct care and treatment agency and is based on a formal, written plan of treatment, or unless federal regulations require payment for an out-of-state resident.",
