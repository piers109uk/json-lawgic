	"text": "If a notice of contest questions only which of the parties to the contest received the highest number of votes legally cast at the election, the contestee need not file an answer, unless the contestee desires to raise issues not specified in the notice of contest.\nFor all other election contests the contestee's answer to the notice of contest must be filed and served on all candidates for the office and on any other party as required by the court. A copy must also be furnished to the governor and secretary of state. The answer must so far as practicable conform to the rules for pleading in civil actions. Service and filing of the answer must be made two days after service of the notice of contest. The contestee's answer must be served in the same manner as the answer in a civil action or in the manner the court may order. Any other notices must be served in the manner and within the times the court may order.",
