A printed copy of the bylaws and a copy of the application shall be attached to the membership certificate when issued, and a copy of any amendment to the bylaws shall be mailed to the members following their adoption. Certified copies of certificate, bylaws and amendments shall be filed with the commissioner of commerce and subject to the commissioner's approval.
