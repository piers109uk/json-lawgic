A person may not possess or transport a fish species taken in the state for which a special fish-management registration is required unless the fish is registered or validated in a manner prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall prescribe the manner of issuance and the type of endorsement as authorized under section 97C.087. Immediately upon reducing the fish to possession, the licensee must validate the license and the license must remain with the fish until the fish is registered. Species for which a special fish management registration is required must be transported undressed, except as otherwise prescribed by the commissioner.\n[See Note.]",
