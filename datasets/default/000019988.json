	"text": "The commissioner of health may: (1) withhold access to health or epidemiologic data if the commissioner determines the data are data on an individual, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 5; or (2) grant access to health or epidemiologic data, if the commissioner determines the data are summary data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 19. In the exercise of this discretion, the commissioner shall consider whether the data requested, alone or in combination, may constitute information from which an individual subject of data may be identified using epidemiologic methods. In making this determination, the commissioner shall consider disease incidence, associated risk factors for illness, and similar factors unique to the data by which it could be linked to a specific subject of the data. This discretion is limited to health or epidemiologic data maintained by the commissioner of health or a community health board, as defined in section 145A.02.",
