When controlled substances are being managed, the policies and procedures must also identify how the provider will ensure security and accountability for the overall management, control, and disposition of those substances in compliance with state and federal regulations and with subdivision 23.\n(a) For each resident who requests medication management services, the facility shall, prior to providing medication management services, have a registered nurse, licensed health professional, or authorized prescriber under section 151.37 conduct an assessment to determine what medication management services will be provided and how the services will be provided. This assessment must be conducted face-to-face with the resident. The assessment must include an identification and review of all medications the resident is known to be taking. The review and identification must include indications for medications, side effects, contraindications, allergic or adverse reactions, and actions to address these issues.\n(b) The assessment must identify interventions needed in management of medications to prevent diversion of medication by the resident or others who may have access to the medications and provide instructions to the resident and legal or designated representatives on interventions to manage the resident's medications and prevent diversion of medications. For purposes of this section, \"diversion of medication\" means misuse, theft, or illegal or improper disposition of medications.\nThe assisted living facility must monitor and reassess the resident's medication management services as needed under subdivision 2 when the resident presents with symptoms or other issues that may be medication-related and, at a minimum, annually.\nThe assisted living facility must document in the resident's record any refusal for an assessment for medication management by the resident.
