	"text": "The Board of Water and Soil Resources, in consultation with counties, soil and water conservation districts, and other appropriate agencies, shall adopt a model ordinance and rules that serve as a guide for local governments to implement sections 103F.401 to 103F.455 and provide administrative procedures for the board for sections 103F.401 to 103F.455.\nThe model ordinance must specify the technical and administrative procedures required to control soil loss and erosion. The model ordinance is the minimum regulation to be adopted. The model ordinance must use the soil loss tolerance for each soil series described in the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service Field Office Technical Guide to determine soil loss limits, but the soil loss limits must be attainable by the best practicable soil conservation practice.\nAt least once every five years the board shall review the rules and model ordinance in cooperation with counties, soil and water conservation districts, and appropriate agencies to ensure their continued applicability and relevance.",
