	"text": "Whenever the commissioner has reason to believe that any person has been engaged or is engaging in this state in any unfair method of competition or any unfair or deceptive act or practice, defined in section 72A.20, and that a proceeding in respect thereto would be to the interest of the public, the commissioner shall issue and serve upon that person a statement of the charges in that respect and a notice of a hearing thereon to be held at a time and place fixed in the notice, which shall not be less than 20 days after the date of the service thereof.\nAt the time and place fixed for such hearing said person shall have an opportunity to be heard and to show cause why an order should not be made by the commissioner requiring the person to cease and desist from the acts, methods, or practices so complained of. Upon good cause shown, the commissioner shall permit any person to intervene, appear and be heard at such hearing by counsel or in person.\nNothing contained in sections 72A.17 to 72A.32 shall require the observance at any such hearing of formal rules of pleading or evidence.\nThe commissioner, upon such a hearing, may administer oaths, examine and cross-examine witnesses, receive oral and documentary evidence, and shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, and require the production of books, papers, records, correspondence, or other documents which the commissioner deems relevant to the inquiry. The commissioner, upon such a hearing, may, and upon the request of any party shall, cause to be made a stenographic record of all the evidence and all the proceedings had at the hearing. If no stenographic record is made and if a judicial review is sought, the commissioner shall prepare a statement of the evidence and proceeding for use on review. In case of a refusal of any person to comply with any subpoena issued hereunder or to testify with respect to any matter concerning which the person may be lawfully interrogated, the District Court of Ramsey County or of the county where the hearing is being held, on application of the commissioner, may issue an order requiring that person to comply with the subpoena and to testify; and any failure to obey any such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.\nStatements of charges, notices, orders, and other processes of the commissioner under sections 72A.17 to 72A.32 may be served by anyone duly authorized by the commissioner, either in the manner provided by law for service of process in civil actions or in compliance with section 45.028, subdivision 2.",
