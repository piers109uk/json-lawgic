	"text": "The State High School League must adopt an affirmative action policy. The reason for the policy is to ensure that jobs within the league are equally accessible to all qualified persons. The policy is also needed to eliminate underemployment by the league of the protected groups that are defined in section 43A.02, subdivision 33.\nThe league must actively and publicly recruit qualified people to become its employees. The league must give special emphasis to recruiting members of protected groups. The league must advertise available positions in newspapers of general circulation. The advertisement must contain a deadline for submitting applications that is at least 14 days after the date of the last advertisement. The league must keep each application for at least six months and must notify an applicant when a position, for which the applicant is qualified, becomes available.\nThe league is a political subdivision under sections 471.992 to 471.999. A cause of action against the league does not arise before August 1, 1989, for failure to comply with sections 471.992 to 471.999.",
