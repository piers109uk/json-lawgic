	"text": "The governing body of the county of Hennepin shall fix the time and manner of payment of salaries to elective and appointive officers and employees paid in whole or in part from county funds. Such salaries may be paid either monthly, semimonthly, or for each two-week period, but no officer or employee whose salary is less than $500 a month shall be paid on a monthly basis.\nUntil the governing body of the county of Hennepin exercises the power herein conferred, the payment of salaries and their manner of payment to elective and appointive officers and employees paid in whole or in part with county funds shall continue to occur in the manner now provided by law.\nIn order to utilize modern accounting methods and equipment in processing salaries the governing body of the county of Hennepin may adjust salaries of elective and appointive officers and employees paid in whole or in part from county funds, whether fixed by statute or otherwise, on an annual, monthly, semimonthly, daily, or other basis so that they may be paid in equal payments throughout the year. The salaries so adjusted shall be based on a year of 2,080 working hours. Odd fractions may be dropped or added in order to permit equal payments throughout the year, regardless of whether the computation slightly decreases or increases the annual, monthly, semimonthly, daily, or other salary of such officers and employees.\nThis section supersedes the provisions of Laws 1957, chapter 945, section 5, relating to the payment of salaries in equal semimonthly installments and any other law relating to the county of Hennepin and governing the time or manner of payment of elective or appointive officers and employees paid in whole or in part from county funds.",
