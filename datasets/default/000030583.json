	"text": "Each authorized child-placing agency shall make special efforts to recruit an adoptive family from among the child's relatives, except as authorized in section 259.57, subdivision 2. Each agency shall provide for the diligent recruitment of potential adoptive families that reflect the ethnic and racial diversity of children in the state for whom adoptive homes are needed. Special efforts include contacting and working with community organizations and religious organizations and may include contracting with these organizations, utilizing local media and other local resources, and conducting outreach activities. The requirement of special efforts to locate relatives in this section is satisfied if special efforts were made to recruit relatives when the child was first placed in out-of-home care or if special efforts have been satisfied and approved by the court according to section 260C.202. The agency may accept any gifts, grants, offers of services, and other contributions to use in making special recruitment efforts.",
