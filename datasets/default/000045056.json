	"text": "All new construction of single-family homes, duplexes, triplexes, and multilevel townhouses that are financed in whole or in part by the agency must incorporate basic visitability access into their design and construction. For the purpose of this section, \"visitability\" means designing a dwelling so that people with mobility impairments may enter and comfortably stay for a duration. The specific design elements include one no-step entrance, 32-inch clear doorways throughout the dwelling, and a one-half bathroom on the main level. The agency may waive the one-half bathroom requirement if it reduces affordability for the targeted population of the agency program from which it is funded. The agency may waive the no-step entrance requirement if site conditions make the requirement impractical or if it reduces affordability for the targeted population of the agency program from which it is funded. This section does not apply to owner-occupied housing financed by the agency through a mortgage program unless the agency has provided appropriated funds to finance the construction of the new owner-occupied housing.",
