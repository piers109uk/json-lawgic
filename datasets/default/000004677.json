	"text": "(a) The board may pay indemnity to cattle owners who choose to euthanize cattle that test suspect for bovine tuberculosis, if funds are available from appropriations for the purpose and if the United States Department of Agriculture refuses to pay indemnity for the animal. The board shall pay fair market value less salvage value as appraised by a disinterested appraiser appointed by the board. The board's decision as to the amount of indemnity is final. If the owner refuses the board's offer, the owner need not dispose of the animal unless and until it later shows positive to any official test for bovine tuberculosis.\n(b) The board is a buyer in the ordinary course of business under chapter 336A when making indemnity payments under this section.",
