	"text": "(a) If there is a surviving spouse, then, in addition to the homestead and family allowance, the surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to:\n(1) property not exceeding $15,000 in value in excess of any security interests therein, in household furniture, furnishings, appliances, and personal effects, subject to an award of sentimental value property under section 525.152; and\n(2) one automobile, if any, without regard to value.\n(b) If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's children are entitled jointly to the same property as provided in paragraph (a), except that where it appears from the decedent's will a child was omitted intentionally, the child is not entitled to the rights conferred by this section.\n(c) If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests, plus that of other exempt property, is less than $15,000, or if there is not $15,000 worth of exempt property in the estate, the surviving spouse or children are entitled to other personal property of the estate, if any, to the extent necessary to make up the $15,000 value.\n(d) Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, but the right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of the family allowance.\n(e) The rights granted by this section are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent's will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession or by way of elective share.\n(f) No rights granted to a decedent's adult children under this section shall have precedence over a claim under section 246.53, 256B.15, 256D.16, 261.04, or 524.3-805, paragraph (a), clause (1), (2), or (3).",
