	"text": "The society may license and regulate shows, exhibitions, performances, and privileges on the fairgrounds, revoke licenses, and prohibit, remove, and summarily stop exhibitions, performances, or privileges which violate society rules or other law.\nThe acceptance of any license given pursuant to subdivision 1 by a nonresident of Minnesota is an appointment by the nonresident of the secretary of state to be a lawful agent upon whom may be served all legal processes in any action or proceeding against the nonresident resulting from the operation of the licensed show, exhibition, performance, or privilege. The acceptance of a license by the nonresident signifies agreement that service of process upon the secretary of state has the same effect as service upon the nonresident personally. Publication of summons need not be made upon the nonresident. In all cases under this subdivision, service of process or service of any writ or notice in an action or proceedings must be made upon the secretary of state in the manner provided by law for service upon residents of the state, and has the same effect as personal service within the state upon the nonresident. After a nonresident appears in an action or proceeding by an attorney residing in Minnesota, papers must be served upon the attorney.\n[Repealed, 1982 c 625 s 16]\nNo person may solicit money or sell or distribute any merchandise or material of any kind without a license issued by the society authorizing the solicitation, sale, or distribution from a fixed location on the fairgrounds.",
