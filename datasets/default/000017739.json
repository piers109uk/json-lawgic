The governing boards of private institutions that grant associate and baccalaureate degrees and that have a high frequency of transfer students are requested to participate in developing these guides.\nThe regents of the University of Minnesota and the trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities shall develop and maintain a common numbering convention to distinguish remedial, lower division, upper division, and graduate level coursework. The governing boards of private institutions that grant associate and baccalaureate degrees are requested to cooperate in the development of this numbering convention.\n[Repealed, 1995 c 212 art 3 s 60]",
