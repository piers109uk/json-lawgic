	"text": "A household goods warehouse operator must file with the department and keep open for public inspection a printed schedule of rates and charges complying with subdivision 2. All tariffs of rates and charges must contain terms and conditions under which the rates and charges are assessed.\nIn order to ensure nondiscriminatory rates and charges for all depositors of household goods, the commissioner shall establish a collective rate-making procedure which will ensure the publication and maintenance of just and reasonable rates and charges under uniform, reasonably related rate structures. These procedures must provide for the joint consideration, initiation, and establishment of rates and charges and ensure that the respective revenues and expenses of household goods warehouse operators are ascertained. Any participating household goods warehouse operator party to a collectively mandated rate or charge has the right to petition the commissioner for the establishment of a rate or charge which deviates from the collectively set rate. Upon receiving the commissioner's approval, that household goods warehouse operator may proceed to establish the requested rate or charge. All household goods warehouse operators subject to rate regulation under this chapter must comply with the commissioner's rate-making procedures. No household goods warehouse operator shall undertake to perform any service or store any household goods until a schedule of rates has been filed and published in accordance with this chapter. In case of emergency, however, a service or storage not specifically covered by the schedules filed, may be performed or furnished at a reasonable rate, which must then be promptly filed, and which is subject to review in accordance with this chapter.",
