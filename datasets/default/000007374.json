	"text": "Section 62A.48 does not prohibit the sale of policies, certificates, subscriber contracts, or other evidences of coverage that provide home care services only. Home care services only policies may be sold, provided that they meet the requirements set forth in sections 62A.46 to 62A.56, except that they do not have to meet those conditions that relate to long-term care in nursing facilities. Disclosures and representations regarding these policies must be adjusted accordingly to remove references to coverage for nursing home care.\nHome health care services issued pursuant to this section may be provided through a limited provider network and may employ managed care practices. If these methods are used, they must be adequately disclosed within the policy and any advertisements or representations regarding coverage. Policies may not be sold in areas where there are not sufficient providers to meet the needs of the policyholders located in that area.\nA long-term care insurance policy or certificate shall not, if it provides benefits for home health care or community care services, limit or exclude benefits by:\n(1) requiring that the insured would need care in a skilled nursing facility if home health care services were not provided;\n(2) requiring that the insured first or simultaneously receive nursing or therapeutic services in a home, community, or institutional setting before home health care services are covered;\n(3) limiting eligible services to services provided by a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse;\n(4) requiring that a nurse or therapist provide services covered by the policy that can be provided by a home health aide or other licensed or certified home care worker acting within the scope of licensure or certification;\n(5) excluding coverage for personal care services provided by a home health aide;\n(6) requiring that the provision of home health care services be at a level of certification or licensure greater than that required by the eligible service;\n(7) requiring that the insured have an acute condition before home health care services are covered;\n(8) limiting benefits to services provided by Medicare-certified agencies or providers;\n(9) excluding coverage for adult day care services; or\n(10) excluding coverage based upon location or type of residence in which the home health care services would be provided.",
