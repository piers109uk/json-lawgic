	"text": "The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under section 524.4-201 or 524.4-205 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state. Any application or petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under sections 524.4-201 and 524.4-205, but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No assets which have been removed from this state by the foreign personal representative through exercise of powers under section 524.4-201 or 524.4-205 shall be subject to subsequent local administration. No person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative or who is a distributee from the foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all rights in others and all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for the foreign personal representative in any action or proceedings in this state.",
