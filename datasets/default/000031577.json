	"text": "The county treasurer shall collect all taxes extended on the tax lists of the county and the fines, forfeitures, or penalties received by any person or officer for the use of the county. The treasurer shall collect the taxes according to law and credit them to the proper funds. This section does not apply to fines and penalties accruing to municipal corporations for the violation of their ordinances that are recoverable before a city justice. Taxes, fines, interest, and penalties must be paid with United States currency or by check, money order, or electronic payments, including, but not limited to, automated clearing house transactions and federal wires drawn on a bank or other financial institution in the United States. The county board may by resolution authorize the treasurer to impose a charge for any dishonored checks or electronic payments. The charges for dishonored payment of property taxes may be added to the tax, shall constitute a lien on the property, and when collected shall be distributed to the county.\nThe county board may, by resolution, authorize the treasurer and/or other designees to accept payments of real property taxes by credit card provided that a fee is charged for its use. The fee charged must be commensurate with the costs assessed by the card issuer. If a credit card transaction under this section is subsequently voided or otherwise reversed, the lien of real property taxes under section 272.31 is revived and attaches in the manner and time provided in that section as though the credit card transaction had never occurred, and the voided or reversed credit card transaction shall not impair the right of a lienholder under section 272.31 to enforce the lien in its favor.",
