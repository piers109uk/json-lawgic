	"title": "507.47 CREATION OF SERVITUDES BY COMMON OWNER.",
	"text": "An easement, condition, restriction, or other servitude that is imposed on real property by a recorded instrument and is not in violation of law or public policy, is valid notwithstanding the common ownership, when the easement, condition, restriction, or other servitude is imposed, of any of the real property burdened or benefited by the easement, condition, restriction, or other servitude. A conveyance of all or any portion of the real property includes the benefits and burdens of all easements, conditions, restrictions, or other servitudes validated under this section, except as provided by sections 500.20 and 541.023. The common law doctrine of merger, and not this section, applies whenever, after ownership of any of the real property is severed, all of the real property burdened or benefited by an easement, condition, restriction, or other servitude again is owned by a common owner.",
