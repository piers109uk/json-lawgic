If the judge finds that the statement is true, and the return is otherwise sufficient, the judge shall decide upon the return and dispose of the matter in accordance with law. The petitioner under this section may appear by attorney and plead to the return as if present. If the petitioner is illegally imprisoned or restrained of liberty, the judge shall order those having custody to immediately discharge the petitioner.
