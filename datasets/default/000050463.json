	"text": "When lots or tracts of real estate are claimed in severalty by two or more persons from or under conveyance from the same grantor, as the common source of title, and an adverse claim of title thereto is made by some person as against the title of such grantor, any one claiming under such grantor may bring an action in behalf of the grantor and all others who may come in and become parties thereto against such adverse claimant, to have the title to such grantor perfected or quieted as to such lots or tracts claimed by the plaintiff and the others who may become parties. Any person who so claims under the same grantor as the plaintiff, and whose title is controverted by the same defendant upon the same ground as the title of the plaintiff, may become a party, as of course, by filing a complaint setting forth the property claimed and the source of title, and may have the claimed rights adjudicated with those of the original plaintiff. The answer of the defendant shall be taken as an answer to all who may thus become parties.",
