In case any party to whom a payment of damages is made be not a resident of the state, or the place of residence be unknown, or the party be an infant or other person under legal disability, or, being legally capable, refuses to accept payment, or if for any reason it be doubtful to whom any payment should be paid, the municipality may pay the same to the clerk, to be paid out under the direction of the court; and, unless an appeal be taken such deposit with the clerk shall be deemed a payment of the award.",
