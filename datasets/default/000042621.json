Park districts shall be of two kinds: (1) single county, which shall be coterminous with a county except that in counties containing a city of the first class such city shall be excluded from the park district; and (2) multicounty, which shall include parts or all of more than one county but shall not include any city of the first class. No park district shall be activated under this chapter until it contains at least part of a county having a population of 350,000 people or more according to the last federal decennial census preceding such activation or an entire county contiguous to a county having such a population. No park district activated hereunder shall contain a county now or hereafter containing a city of the first class which occupies more than 30 percent of the county by area.",
