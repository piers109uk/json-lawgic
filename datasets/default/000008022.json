However, an enrollee may proceed to external review without exhausting the internal complaint or appeal process under the following circumstances:\n(i) the health plan company waives the exhaustion requirement;\n(ii) the health plan company is considered to have waived the exhaustion requirement by failing to substantially comply with any requirements including, but not limited to, time limits for internal complaints or appeals; or\n(iii) the enrollee has applied for an expedited external review at the same time the enrollee has applied for internal review under chapter 62M.",
