	"text": "The commissioner may, upon request, provide a written authorization to a responsible party, owner of real property, or other person, for land application of contaminated media. A written land application request must be submitted to the commissioner, in a form prescribed by the commissioner, and approved by the commissioner prior to any land application. The commissioner may approve a land application request if the commissioner determines that the land application will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment. An authorization for land application must prescribe appropriate application rates and other operational control practices to protect human health and the environment and must identify each site or sites where land application is authorized to be performed.\nA land application specifically allowed under a state or federal permit, license, or other written approval by an authorized state or federal agency is exempt from this section. In the event of an emergency, or for small quantities of contaminated media, as determined by the commissioner, contaminated media may be land applied without prior written approval, providing that the land application is orally approved by the commissioner prior to the application. The commissioner shall confirm the oral approval in writing within three business days of an oral approval.",
