	"text": "Where performing or doing any act, duty, matter, payment, or thing is ordered or directed, and the period of time or duration for performing or doing it is prescribed and fixed by law, rule, or order, the time, except as otherwise provided in subdivision 2, is computed so as to exclude the first and include the last day of any such prescribed or fixed period or duration of time. When the last day of the period falls on Sunday or on any day made a legal holiday, by the laws of this state or of the United States, the day is omitted from the computation.\nWhen the lapse of a number of months before or after a certain day is required by law, rule, or order, the number of months is computed by counting the months from the day, excluding the calendar month in which the day occurs, and including the day of the month in the last month so counted having the same numerical order as the day of the month from which the computation is made, unless there be not so many days in the last month so counted, in which case the period computed shall expire with the last day of the month so counted.",
