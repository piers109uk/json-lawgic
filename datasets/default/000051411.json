The attachment must direct the sheriff or coroner to apprehend the person upon whom the writ is served as soon as possible and bring that person before the judge before whom the writ is returnable. The judge before whom the writ is returnable shall commit the person apprehended under the attachment to the county jail until that person makes the return and complies with all other orders made by the judge.",
