	"text": "(a) A voter described in section 203B.16, subdivision 1, may use the federal write-in absentee ballot to vote in any federal, state, or local election. In a state or local election, a vote for a political party without specifying the name of a candidate must not be counted.\n(b) If a voter submits a federal write-in absentee ballot for which a federal post card application was not received, the federal write-in absentee ballot serves as a voter registration, for voters who are eligible to register, in lieu of the voter's federal post card application. If the voter has not already voted and the accompanying certificate is properly completed, the absentee ballot board must accept the federal write-in absentee ballot.",
