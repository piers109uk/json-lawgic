	"text": "A staff adjuster who adjusts losses or claims in this state shall not be subject to the application, licensing, or examination requirements or other qualifications set forth in sections 72B.01 to 72B.136. Such a staff adjuster shall not, however, engage in any of the practices forbidden to a licensee under section 72B.08, subdivision 1, clauses (3) through (15). If the commissioner has information, which if true, would establish that a staff adjuster has engaged or is engaging in any such prohibited practices, the commissioner may issue an order for a hearing to determine the facts involved. The order shall fix the time and place for hearing. The staff adjuster and one or more representatives of the insurer or insurers employing the staff adjuster shall make an appearance at the hearing unless the commissioner expressly waives the appearance of one or more such parties. If, following the hearing, the commissioner determines that the staff adjuster has engaged or is engaging in any prohibited practices, the commissioner may impose a fine, not in excess of $500, on the staff adjuster or on the employing insurer or insurers, or on both such parties. In addition, the commissioner may order the employing insurer to suspend the staff adjuster from all duties for such period as the commissioner may deem appropriate.\nAny final order of the commissioner shall be subject to judicial review. Any hearing or judicial review under this section shall be in accordance with the contested case provisions of chapter 14.",
