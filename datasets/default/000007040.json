The term \"expense,\" as used in this section, may exclude some or all taxes as stipulated in the contracts and may also exclude any investment management fee which is subject to change with the approval by vote of the holders of such contracts.\nAny life insurance contract on a variable basis delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall stipulate the investment increment factor to be used in computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other variable contractual payments or values thereunder and shall guarantee that expense and mortality results shall not adversely affect such dollar amounts.",
