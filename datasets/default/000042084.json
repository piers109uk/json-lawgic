	"text": "Sections 390.31 to 390.35 provide a simplified system for the investigation of the death of any person when the county attorney determines that an investigation is necessary and provide for professional assistance to those making the investigation. It is declared to be in the public interest for medical doctors to conduct the medical investigations deemed necessary under the supervision of the county attorney and, if a trial is deemed necessary, that it be held in a court of record.\nEach juror sworn in an action pending before a sheriff on a writ of inquiry shall receive $3 to be paid, in the first instance in all civil actions, by the party calling for the jurors.\nWhen the sheriff is a party to an action or when any party, or the party's agent or attorney, files with the court administrator of the district court an affidavit stating that the party believes the sheriff, because of partiality, prejudice, consanguinity, or interest, will not faithfully perform the sheriff's duties in an action commenced, or about to be commenced, the court administrator shall direct process in the action to the county attorney. The attorney shall perform the duties of the sheriff relative to the action in the manner required for a sheriff.",
