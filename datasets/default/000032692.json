	"text": "(a) Claimants enrolling any land that is subject to a conservation easement funded under section 97A.056 or a comparable permanent easement conveyed to a governmental or nonprofit entity must enroll their land under a covenant with a minimum duration of eight years. All other claimants may choose to enroll their land under a covenant with a minimum duration of eight, 20, or 50 years. If the claimant requests removal of land from the program before it has been enrolled for one-half the number of years of the covenant's duration, the covenant remains in effect for the entire duration of the covenant from the date recorded.\n(b) If land that has been enrolled for one-half the number of years of the covenant's minimum duration or more is removed from the program for any reason, there is a waiting period before the covenant terminates. The covenant terminates on January 1 of the fifth, 11th, or 26th calendar year for the eight-, 20-, or 50-year minimum covenant, respectively, that begins after the date that:\n(1) the commissioner receives notification from the claimant that the claimant wishes to remove the land from the program under section 290C.10; or\n(2) the date that the land is removed from the program under section 290C.11.\n(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the covenant is terminated:\n(1) at the same time that the land is removed from the program due to acquisition of title or possession for a public purpose under section 290C.10; or\n(2) at the request of the claimant (i) if there is a reduction in payments due to changes in the payment formula under section 290C.07; or (ii) if, as a result of executive action, the amount of payment a claimant is eligible to receive under section 290C.07 is reduced or limited.",
