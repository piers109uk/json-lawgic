	"text": "(a) Upon complaint of any interested permit holder questioning the accuracy of any scale, count, or estimate of timber made by any state appraiser, or at any other time the commissioner determines in the absence of a complaint, the commissioner may cause a rescale, recount, or reestimate thereof to be made jointly by any two or more state appraisers, which when made shall supersede and for all purposes take the place of the original scale, count, or estimate, if and only when the scale or count varies more than ten percent from the original or the estimate exceeds the standards established by section 90.045.\n(b) As a condition precedent to the making of a rescale, recount, or reestimate upon the complaint of any person, the commissioner may require the person to make available such sum of money as the commissioner deems necessary for the actual expenses thereof and to forfeit the same to the state if the rescale and recount does not vary more than ten percent from the original or the reestimate does not exceed the standards established by section 90.045. All forfeited money shall be paid into the state treasury and credited to the fund or account from which the expenses of the rescale, recount, or reestimate were paid.",
