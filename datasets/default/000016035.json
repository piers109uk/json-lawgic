	"text": "(a) An action may be brought against any district, either upon a contract made with the district or its board, in its official capacity and within the scope of its authority, or for an injury to the rights of the plaintiff arising from some act or omission of such board. The action may be brought against the district even if the members of the board making the contract, or guilty of the act or omission complained of, are no longer in office.\n(b) Upon written request of the teacher involved, any district, however organized, must provide legal counsel for any school teacher against whom claim is made or action is brought for recovery of damages in any tort action involving physical injury to any person or property or for wrongful death arising out of or in connection with the employment of such teacher with the district. The choice of legal counsel shall be made only after consultation with the teacher. Provision of counsel under this paragraph shall not be construed to render the district liable for its torts, except as otherwise provided by law; or for reimbursement of costs of counsel provided to the teacher pursuant to the contract obligation of another or otherwise than under this paragraph; or for payment of any judgments or any other costs or disbursements in connection with a judgment where the judgment, cost or disbursement is against the teacher and not against the school district.\n(c) It is a defense to a civil action for damages against a school official, as defined in section 609.2231, subdivision 5, to prove that the force used by the official was reasonable, was in the exercise of lawful authority, and was necessary under the circumstances to restrain the pupil or to prevent bodily harm or death to another.",
