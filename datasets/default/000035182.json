	"text": "A church or society organized as such, and not incorporated, may become a corporation by executing, acknowledging, and having recorded with the proper officers a certificate of incorporation under this chapter. When it does, and when any existing religious corporation reincorporates under this chapter, property and franchises belonging to the society, or original corporation vest in the corporation so organized. Rights in pews possessed by members at the time of reorganization are not impaired. The board of trustees or other governing body of a reorganizing corporation, or their survivors, when requested by the governing board of the new corporation, shall convey to the new corporation, by sufficient deed, all property owned by it. The conveyance must recite the fact of reorganization, and pass title to the property described in it possessed by the corporation in whose behalf it is executed. It is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in it.",
