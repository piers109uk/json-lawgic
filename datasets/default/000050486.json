	"text": "Proof shall be made of the existence, amount, and priority of any liens on the property of which partition is sought in such manner and upon such notice to those interested as the court shall direct. When any person having a lien has not been made a party, the court may make an order requiring that person to appear and become a party defendant, and no such person can be affected by a sale unless made a party. If there are liens on the property amounting to more than its value as alleged in the complaint, or if it appears probable after examination that the property will not sell for a sum in cash equal to the amount of such liens, with costs and expenses, no sale shall be ordered; but, if such liens do not amount to the value of the property as admitted or proved, the court may order a sale, and in such case the sale shall not be delayed by the proceedings to ascertain the priority of the liens.",
