	"text": "The city of Minneapolis may enter into agreements with the Metropolitan Council and the commission which requires the municipality to impose a sales tax, supplemental to the general sales tax imposed in chapter 297A, for the purposes and in accordance with the requirements specified in sections 473.551 to 473.599. The tax may be imposed:\n(a) on the gross receipts from all retail on-sales of intoxicating liquor and fermented malt beverages when sold at licensed on-sale liquor establishments and municipal liquor stores located within the municipality,\n(b) notwithstanding any limitations of Laws 1986, chapter 396, section 5, clause (2), on the gross receipts from the furnishing for consideration of lodging for a period of less than 30 days at a hotel, motel, rooming house, tourist court, or trailer camp located within the municipality,\n(c) on the gross receipts on all sales of food primarily for consumption on or off the premises by restaurants and places of refreshment as defined by resolution of the city, or\n(d) on any one or combination of the foregoing.\nA tax under this subdivision shall be imposed only within a downtown taxing area to be determined by the council.\nThe agreement or agreements between the city, the Metropolitan Council, and the commission shall require the municipality to impose the tax or taxes at whatever rate or rates may be necessary to produce revenues which are determined by the council from year to year to be required, together with the revenues available to the commission, to pay when due all debt service on bonds and revenue anticipation certificates issued under section 473.581, all debt service on bonds and revenue anticipation certificates issued under section 473.599, and all expenses of operation, administration, and maintenance of the Metrodome and the basketball and hockey arena. When it is determined that a tax must be imposed under this subdivision after the effective date of Laws 1994, chapter 648, there shall be added to the rate of the tax imposed for the purposes described in the previous sentence a tax at a rate of 0.25 percent for use by the city to fund recreational facilities and programs in the city's neighborhoods for children and youth through the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. The agreements shall provide for the suspension, reimposition, reduction, or increase in tax collections upon determination by the Metropolitan Council that such actions are appropriate or necessary for the purposes for which the tax is imposed, provided that the balance in each of the Metrodome debt service and the basketball and hockey arena debt service fund or funds, including any reserve for debt service, shall be maintained at least at an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on bonds which will become due within the next succeeding one year period and, except as otherwise provided by agreement, shall not be maintained at an amount greater than that required to pay principal and interest on bonds which will become due within the next succeeding two-year period. Once the tax is imposed by the city, the tax imposed for the benefit of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board shall remain in effect at the rate of 0.25 percent until the bonds issued under section 473.599 have been retired. The agreements shall be executed by the city, after approval by resolution of the city council and before the issuance of the bonds under section 473.581 and commencement of construction of the Metrodome or the issuance of bonds under section 473.599 and acquisition of the basketball and hockey arena and shall constitute a contract or contracts with and for the security of all holders of the bonds and revenue anticipation certificates secured by the tax. The Metrodome shall not be constructed or remodeled in a municipality which has not entered into an agreement for the Metrodome in accordance with this section. A basketball and hockey arena shall not be acquired in the city of Minneapolis unless the city has entered into an agreement in accordance with this section as security for bonds issued pursuant to section 473.599 and expenses of operation, administration, and maintenance of the basketball and hockey arena. The tax shall be reported and paid to the commissioner of revenue with and as part of the state sales and use taxes, and shall be subject to the same penalties, interest, and enforcement provisions. The collections of the tax, less refunds and a proportionate share of the costs of collection, shall be remitted at least quarterly to the Metropolitan Council and the city of Minneapolis for use by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. The commissioner of revenue shall deduct from the proceeds remitted to the council and the city an amount that equals the indirect statewide costs as well as the direct and indirect department costs necessary to administer, audit, and collect this tax. The amount deducted shall be deposited in the general fund of the state. The proceeds remitted with respect to the Metrodome shall be placed, together with the net revenues of the commission attributable to the Metrodome under section 473.595, into the debt service fund or reserve or special funds, established under section 473.581, and any funds established to secure payment of operating deficits of the commission arising from its ownership and operation of the Metrodome. The proceeds may be used for payment of debt service on bonds and revenue anticipation certificates issued under section 473.581, and expenses of operation, administration, and maintenance of the Metrodome. The proceeds shall not be used for any capital costs of the Metrodome, except that the proceeds may be used to pay interest on bonds during the construction period.\nThe proceeds remitted with respect to the basketball and hockey arena shall be placed, together with the net revenues of the commission attributable to the basketball and hockey arena under section 473.595, subdivision 1a, into the debt service fund or reserve or special funds, established under section 473.599, and any funds established to secure payment of operating deficits of the commission arising from its acquisition, ownership, operation, or maintenance of the basketball and hockey arena.
