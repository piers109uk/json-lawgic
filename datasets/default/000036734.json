If the state prevails in an action to enforce sections 325M.10 to 325M.21, the state may, in addition to penalties provided by paragraph (c) or other remedies provided by law, be allowed an amount determined by the court to be the reasonable value of all or part of the state's litigation expenses incurred.\n(c) Any controller or processor that violates sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 is subject to an injunction and liable for a civil penalty of not more than $7,500 for each violation.\n(d) Nothing in sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 establishes a private right of action, including under section 8.31, subdivision 3a, for a violation of sections 325M.10 to 325M.21 or any other law.",
