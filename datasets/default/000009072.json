If no hearing is requested within 30 days from the date of the notice, the action taken by the commissioner shall continue in effect until modified or vacated. If a hearing is timely requested, the commissioner shall set a date for such hearing not later than 30 days after the date of receipt of the request for hearing. Pending the hearing or any judicial review of such hearing, the commissioner may modify or vacate the action taken or extend it until final determination.\nAfter the hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order either vacating the prior action, confirming the prior action or otherwise disposing of the matter as the facts require.\nWhen the commissioner has information, which if true, would be grounds for suspension, revocation, or refusal to issue a renewal license or a temporary permit, the commissioner may order the licensee or holder of the temporary permit to appear for a hearing pursuant to chapter 14, to determine the facts of the case and to determine whether the license or permit should be suspended or revoked, or whether it should not be renewed. The order shall fix the time and place for the hearing. After the hearing, the commissioner shall enter an order either dismissing the matter or suspending or revoking the license or temporary permit, or otherwise disposing of the matter as the facts require. Pending the results of the hearing, the licensee or permit holder may continue to act under the license or permit.\nThe license of a business entity may be probated, suspended, revoked, or refused if the commissioner finds, after a hearing, that:\n(1) its designated individual licensee's violation occurred while acting on behalf of or representing the business entity;\n(2) the violation was known or should have been known by one or more of the business entity's partners, officers, or managers;\n(3) the violation was not reported to the commissioner; and\n(4) corrective action was not taken.\nIn addition to or in lieu of any applicable probation, suspension, revocation, or refusal, a person may, after a hearing, additionally be subject to a civil fine according to section 45.027, subdivision 6.\nThe commissioner retains the authority to enforce the provisions of and impose any penalty or remedy authorized by this chapter and section 45.027, subdivision 6, against any person who is under investigation for or charged with a violation of this chapter or sections 72A.17 to 72A.32, even if the person's license or registration has been surrendered or has expired by operation of law.\nAny final order of the commissioner shall be subject to judicial review.\nAny hearing or judicial review shall be in accordance with the contested case provisions of chapter 14.\nThe commissioner may request a voluntary revocation or suspension of a license or temporary permit and may enter into stipulations in accordance with the request whereby the licensee or holder of a temporary permit shall waive all further right to a hearing or judicial review.\nIn the case of any licensee or permit holder who has had a license or permit suspended or revoked or whose license renewal has been prohibited by a lawful order of the commissioner, the commissioner may condition the issuance of a new license on the filing of a surety bond in an amount not to exceed $10,000, made and conditioned in accordance with the requirements of section 72B.041, subdivision 3, relating to public adjusters' bonds. Nothing in this subdivision shall reduce or alter the bonding requirements for a public adjuster.\nThis section shall not relieve a person from civil liability or from criminal prosecution under sections 72B.01 to 72B.136 or any other law of this state.",
