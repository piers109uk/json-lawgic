	"text": "(a) It is the policy of the state of Minnesota to provide a coordinated approach to the supervision, protection, and habilitation of its adult citizens with a developmental disability. In furtherance of this policy, sections 252A.01 to 252A.21 are enacted to authorize the commissioner of human services to:\n(1) supervise those adult citizens with a developmental disability who are unable to fully provide for their own needs and for whom no qualified person is willing and able to seek guardianship under sections 524.5-101 to 524.5-502; and\n(2) protect adults with a developmental disability from violation of their human and civil rights by ensuring that they receive the full range of needed social, financial, residential, and habilitative services to which they are lawfully entitled.\n(b) Public guardianship is the most restrictive form of guardianship and should be imposed only when less restrictive alternatives have been attempted and determined to be insufficient to meet the person's needs. Less restrictive alternatives include but are not limited to supported decision making, community or residential services, or appointment of a health care agent.\nSections 252A.01 to 252A.21 may be cited as the \"Public Guardianship for Adults with Developmental Disabilities Act.\"",
