	"text": "The legislature finds and declares that it is necessary to establish minimum training requirements for part-time peace officers in certain specified areas to maximize protection of the rights and safety of the public and to minimize liability on the part of Minnesota counties and municipalities. The legislature further finds that part-time peace officers are most effectively utilized as a supplement to regular, fully trained and licensed, peace officers and does not encourage the use of part-time peace officers when needs for service would otherwise justify the use of peace officers.",
