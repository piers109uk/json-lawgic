	"text": "For purposes of this section, terms defined in section 116J.8737 have the meaning given in that section.\nA qualified investor is allowed a credit against the tax imposed under this chapter for qualified investments made in a qualified small business for the taxable year. The credit equals the amount and applies to the taxable year indicated on the certificate provided to the qualified investor under section 116J.8737, but the maximum credit in any taxable year is $250,000 for a married couple filing a joint return, and $125,000 for all other claimants.\nEach pass-through entity must provide each investor a statement indicating the investor's share of the credit amount certified to the pass-through entity based on its share of the pass-through entity's capital assets at the time of the qualified investment.\nIf the amount of the credit under this section for any taxable year exceeds the claimant's liability for tax under this chapter, the commissioner shall refund the excess to the claimant. An amount sufficient to pay the refunds required by this section is appropriated to the commissioner from the general fund.\nNotwithstanding the certification eligibility issued by the commissioner of employment and economic development under section 116J.8737, the commissioner may utilize any audit and examination powers under chapter 270C or 289A to the extent necessary to verify that the taxpayer is eligible for the credit and to assess for the amount of any improperly claimed credit.\nThis section expires at the same time and on the same terms as section 116J.8737, except that the expiration of this section does not affect the commissioner of revenue's authority to audit or power of examination and assessment for credits claimed under this section.",
