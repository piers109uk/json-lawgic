Treatment or therapy management services cannot be provided by a home care provider that has a basic home care license.\n(a) A comprehensive home care provider who provides treatment and therapy management services must develop, implement, and maintain up-to-date written treatment or therapy management policies and procedures. The policies and procedures must be developed under the supervision and direction of a registered nurse or appropriate licensed health professional consistent with current practice standards and guidelines.\n(b) The written policies and procedures must address requesting and receiving orders or prescriptions for treatments or therapies, providing the treatment or therapy, documenting of treatment or therapy activities, educating and communicating with clients about treatments or therapy they are receiving, monitoring and evaluating the treatment and therapy, and communicating with the prescriber.\nFor each client receiving management of ordered or prescribed treatments or therapy services, the comprehensive home care provider must prepare and include in the service plan a written statement of the treatment or therapy services that will be provided to the client. The provider must also develop and maintain a current individualized treatment and therapy management record for each client which must contain at least the following:\n(1) a statement of the type of services that will be provided;\n(2) documentation of specific client instructions relating to the treatments or therapy administration;\n(3) identification of treatment or therapy tasks that will be delegated to unlicensed personnel;\n(4) procedures for notifying a registered nurse or appropriate licensed health professional when a problem arises with treatments or therapy services; and\n(5) any client-specific requirements relating to documentation of treatment and therapy received, verification that all treatment and therapy was administered as prescribed, and monitoring of treatment or therapy to prevent possible complications or adverse reactions. The treatment or therapy management record must be current and updated when there are any changes.\nOrdered or prescribed treatments or therapies must be administered by a nurse, physician, or other licensed health professional authorized to perform the treatment or therapy, or may be delegated or assigned to unlicensed personnel by the licensed health professional according to the appropriate practice standards for delegation or assignment. When administration of a treatment or therapy is delegated or assigned to unlicensed personnel, the home care provider must ensure that the registered nurse or authorized licensed health professional has:\n(1) instructed the unlicensed personnel in the proper methods with respect to each client and the unlicensed personnel has demonstrated the ability to competently follow the procedures;\n(2) specified, in writing, specific instructions for each client and documented those instructions in the client's record; and\n(3) communicated with the unlicensed personnel about the individual needs of the client.\nEach treatment or therapy administered by a comprehensive home care provider must be documented in the client's record. The documentation must include the signature and title of the person who administered the treatment or therapy and must include the date and time of administration. When treatment or therapies are not administered as ordered or prescribed, the provider must document the reason why it was not administered and any follow-up procedures that were provided to meet the client's needs.\nThere must be an up-to-date written or electronically recorded order from an authorized prescriber for all treatments and therapies. The order must contain the name of the client, a description of the treatment or therapy to be provided, and the frequency, duration, and other information needed to administer the treatment or therapy.
