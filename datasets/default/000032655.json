	"text": "It is the policy of this state to promote sustainable forest resource management on the state's public and private lands. The state's private forests comprise approximately one-half of the state forest land resources. These forests play a critical role in protecting water quality and soil resources, and provide extensive wildlife habitat, natural carbon sequestration, diverse recreational experiences, and significant forest products that support the state's economy. Ad valorem property taxes represent a significant annual cost that can discourage long-term forest management investments. In order to foster silviculture investments and retain these forests for their economic and ecological benefits, this chapter, hereafter referred to as the \"Sustainable Forest Incentive Act,\" is enacted to encourage the state's private forest landowners to make a long-term commitment to sustainable forest management.",
