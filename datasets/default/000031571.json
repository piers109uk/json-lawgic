	"text": "When a payment described in this section is required to be made to a county on or before the prescribed date, the payment is timely if received by the county on or before a prescribed date, or if mailed on or before that date. This section applies to the payment of current or delinquent real or personal property taxes, any other amount shown as payable on a property tax statement, and all related penalties, interest, or costs.\nMailing is timely under this section only if the payment was deposited in the mail in the United States on or before the due date, in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper, postage prepaid, and properly addressed.\nThe postmark or registration mark of the United States Postal Service qualifies as proof of timely mailing. Mailing, or the time of mailing, may also be established by a delivery service's records or other available evidence. The postmark of a private postage meter or an electronic stamp purchased online may not be used as proof of a timely mailing made under this section.\nIn any case in which the payment is not treated as timely mailed under this section, the date of receipt governs for purposes of determining the amount of any penalty, interest, or cost assessment.",
