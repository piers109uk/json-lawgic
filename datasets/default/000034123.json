The name of that corporation may contain the word \"cooperative\" if it is a cooperative corporation generally similar to the kind which may be organized under the laws of this state. If that corporation is a corporation obtaining a certificate of authority pursuant to the provisions of section 303.04, the name of that corporation may contain the words \"bank,\" \"trust,\" \"building and loan,\" or \"savings\" and such corporation shall not be required to add the word \"incorporated\" or the abbreviation \"Inc.\" to its corporate name.
