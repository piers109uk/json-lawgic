	"text": "For the purposes of sections 611A.01 to 611A.06:\n(a) \"Crime\" means conduct that is prohibited by local ordinance and results in bodily harm to an individual; or conduct that is included within the definition of \"crime\" in section 609.02, subdivision 1, or would be included within that definition but for the fact that (1) the person engaging in the conduct lacked capacity to commit the crime under the laws of this state, or (2) the act was alleged or found to have been committed by a juvenile.\n(b) \"Victim\" means a natural person who incurs loss or harm as a result of a crime, including a good faith effort to prevent a crime, and for purposes of sections 611A.04 and 611A.045, also includes (1) a corporation that incurs loss or harm as a result of a crime, (2) a government entity that incurs loss or harm as a result of a crime, and (3) any other entity authorized to receive restitution under section 609.10 or 609.125. The term \"victim\" includes the family members, guardian, conservator, or custodian of a minor, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased person. In a case where the prosecutor finds that the number of family members makes it impracticable to accord all of the family members the rights described in sections 611A.02 to 611A.0395, the prosecutor shall establish a reasonable procedure to give effect to those rights. The procedure may not limit the number of victim impact statements submitted to the court under section 611A.038. The term \"victim\" does not include the person charged with or alleged to have committed the crime.\n(c) \"Juvenile\" has the same meaning as given to the term \"child\" in section 260B.007, subdivision 3.",
