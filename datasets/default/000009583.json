	"text": "For the purposes of this section, \"service bay\" means an enclosed area where automobile repairs are performed, including, but not limited to, lubrication, oil change, tire repair, battery charge, replacement of fan belts, hoses, and wiper blades.\nA marketing agreement that includes a lease of the facility to the dealer must provide that if the supplier eliminates one or more service bays during the term of the marketing agreement, the supplier must first pay to the dealer in cash an amount that fairly and adequately compensates the dealer for the loss of the service and repair business.\nThe provision required by subdivision 2 may not be waived or modified except in a writing signed by the dealer executed at least 30 days after the execution of the marketing agreement. The writing must be separate and independent from the marketing agreement, and shall eliminate the payment provisions of subdivision 2.\nNothing in this subdivision prohibits a supplier from altering, modifying, or remodeling a full-service station, without payment to the dealer, following the expiration of the franchise relationship based upon termination or nonrenewal of the franchise relationship in accordance with United States Code, title 15, section 2802(b)(3)(D).",
