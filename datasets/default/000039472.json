	"text": "When it appears that any witness subpoenaed or required to appear on behalf of the state has come from another state or country or is indigent, the court may, by order upon the minutes, direct the county treasurer to pay the witness a reasonable sum for expenses. When a prosecution in the name of the state fails, or the defendant proves insolvent, escapes, or is unable to pay the fees when convicted, they shall be paid out of the county treasury, unless otherwise ordered by the court. The court administrator of court upon request of the county attorney or the attorney general may issue subpoenas and compel the attendance of witnesses in behalf of the state or county without payment of fees in advance; and, in criminal cases, the witnesses for the defendant shall also be compelled to attend without payment of fees in advance, and failure to attend after being served with a subpoena shall subject any witness to be proceeded against in the same manner as provided by law in other cases where payment of fees is required to be paid in advance. The court administrator of any court in which a witness has attended on behalf of the state in a civil action shall give the witness a certificate of attendance and travel, which entitles the witness to receive the amount from the county treasurer.",
