	"text": "To participate in the postsecondary enrollment options program, a college or university must abide by the provisions in this section. The institution may provide information about its programs to a secondary school or to a pupil or parent and may recruit or solicit participation on educational and programmatic grounds.\nAn institution shall not enroll secondary pupils, for postsecondary enrollment options purposes, in developmental courses or other courses that are not college level. For the purposes of this section, a \"developmental course\" means a postsecondary course taken to prepare a student for college-level work and for which the postsecondary institution does not grant credit or which cannot be used to meet degree, diploma, or certificate requirements.\nNotwithstanding section 135A.08 or other law to the contrary, all MnSCU institutions must give full credit to a secondary pupil who completes for postsecondary credit a postsecondary course or program that is part or all of a goal area or a transfer curriculum at a MnSCU institution when the pupil enrolls in a MnSCU institution after leaving secondary school. Once one MnSCU institution certifies as completed a secondary student's postsecondary course or program that is part or all of a goal area or a transfer curriculum, every MnSCU institution must consider the student's course or program for that goal area or the transfer curriculum as completed.",
