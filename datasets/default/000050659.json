	"text": "Such actions shall be governed by the rules governing civil actions, except as herein otherwise provided, but every allegation in every answer shall be deemed in issue without further pleading. When in any such action it appears to the court that any owner, lienholder, or person interested in any of the tracts involved ought, for a full settlement and adjudication of all the questions involved, to be made a party, the court shall stay the proceedings and issue an order requiring such persons to come in and plead therein within 20 days after service of the order, which shall be served upon them in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. Any person so served who shall fail to file an answer within 20 days thereafter shall be in default. All pleadings or copies thereof shall be filed before such order is made. The court may also, in its discretion, in like manner, order the owners and persons interested in other tracts than those originally involved to come in and plead, in which case the order shall describe such additional tracts, and state that the purpose of the action is to establish the boundary lines thereof.",
