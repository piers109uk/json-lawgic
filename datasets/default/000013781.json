	"text": "Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, an incinerator permit issued to a facility that allows burning of PCBs must, as a condition of the permit, require the installation of a continuous emission monitoring system approved by the commissioner. The monitoring system must provide continuous emission measurements to ensure optimum combustion efficiency of dioxin precursors. The system must also be capable of providing a permanent record of monitored emissions that will be available upon request to the commissioner and the general public. The commissioner shall provide periodic inspection of the monitoring system to determine its continued accuracy. Should, at any time, the permitted facility's emissions exceed permit requirements based on accurate and valid emissions data, the facility shall immediately commence shutdown of the incinerator until the appropriate modifications to the facility have been made to ensure its ability to meet permitted requirements.",
