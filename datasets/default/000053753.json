	"text": "Upon application by the prosecuting authority, a court may issue an attachment order directing a financial institution to freeze some or all of the funds or assets deposited with or held by the financial institution by or on behalf of an account holder charged with the commission of a felony.\nThe application of the prosecuting authority required by this section must contain:\n(1) a copy of a criminal complaint issued by a court of competent jurisdiction that alleges the commission of a felony by the account holder;\n(2) a statement of the actual financial loss caused by the account holder in the commission of the alleged felony, if not already stated in the complaint; and\n(3) identification of the account holder's name and financial institution account number.\nIf the court finds that (1) there is probable cause that the account holder was involved in the commission of a felony; (2) the accounts of the account holder are specifically identified; (3) there was a loss of $10,000 or more as a result of the commission of the alleged felony; and (4) it is necessary to freeze the account holder's funds or assets to ensure eventual restitution to victims of the alleged offense, the court may order the financial institution to freeze all or part of the account holder's deposited funds or assets so that the funds or assets may not be withdrawn or disposed of until further order of the court.\nUpon receipt of the order authorized by this section, a financial institution must not permit any funds or assets that were frozen by the order to be withdrawn or disposed of until further order of the court.\n(a) The account holder may, upon notice and motion, have a hearing to contest the freezing of funds or assets and to seek the release of all or part of them.\n(b) The account holder is entitled to an order releasing the freeze by showing:\n(1) that the account holder has posted a bond or other adequate surety, guaranteeing that, upon conviction, adequate funds or assets will be available to pay complete restitution to victims of the alleged offense;\n(2) that there is no probable cause to believe that the account holder was involved in the alleged offense;\n(3) that the amount of funds or assets frozen is more than is necessary to pay complete restitution to all victims of the alleged offense;\n(4) that a joint account holder who is not involved in the alleged criminal activity has deposited all or part of the funds or assets; or\n(5) that the funds or assets should be returned in the interests of justice.\n(c) It is not grounds for the release of funds or assets that the particular accounts frozen do not contain funds or assets that were proceeds from or used in the commission of the alleged offense.\n(a) If the account holder is convicted of a felony or a lesser offense, the funds or assets may be used to pay complete restitution to victims of the offense. The court may order the financial institution to remit all or part of the frozen funds or assets to the court.\n(b) If the account holder is acquitted or the charges are dismissed, the court must issue an order releasing the freeze on the funds or assets.\nThe freeze permitted by this section expires 24 months after the date of the court's initial attachment order unless the time limit is extended by the court in writing upon a showing of good cause by the prosecution.\nWithin ten days after a court issues an attachment order under this section, the prosecutor shall send a copy of the order to the account holder's last known address or to the account holder's attorney, if known.",
