	"text": "(a) The department may obtain monetary recovery from a provider who has been improperly paid by the child care assistance program, regardless of whether the error was intentional. Overpayments designated solely as agency error, and not the result of acts or omissions on the part of a provider or recipient, must not be established or collected. The department does not need to establish a pattern as a precondition of monetary recovery of erroneous or false billing claims, duplicate billing claims, or billing claims based on false statements or financial misconduct.\n(b) The department shall obtain monetary recovery from providers by the following means:\n(1) permitting voluntary repayment of money, either in lump-sum payment or installment payments;\n(2) using any legal collection process;\n(3) deducting or withholding program payments; or\n(4) utilizing the means set forth in chapter 16D.\nThe department is authorized to calculate the amount of monetary recovery from a provider, license holder, or controlling individual based upon extrapolation from a statistical random sample of claims submitted by the provider, license holder, or controlling individual and paid by the child care assistance program. The department's random sample extrapolation shall constitute a rebuttable presumption of the accuracy of the calculation of monetary recovery. If the presumption is not rebutted by the provider, license holder, or controlling individual in the appeal process, the department shall use the extrapolation as the monetary recovery figure. The department may use sampling and extrapolation to calculate the amount of monetary recovery if the claims to be reviewed represent services to 50 or more children in care.\n[Repealed, 2015 c 78 art 4 s 62]",
