	"text": "When public convenience requires the same, every telephone company shall, for a reasonable compensation, permit a physical connection or connections to be made, and telephone service to be furnished between any telephone exchange system operated by it, and the telephone toll line or lines operated by another company, or between its telephone toll line or lines and the telephone exchange system of another telephone company, or between its toll line and the toll line of another company, whenever such physical connection or connections are practicable and will not result in irreparable injury to the telephone system so compelled to be connected. The term \"physical connection,\" as used in this section, means such number of trunk lines or complete wire circuits and connections as may be required to furnish reasonable and adequate service between such telephone lines and exchanges and shall not be deemed to provide for any connection whereby one line or circuit is to be bridged upon another line or circuit. In case of failure of the telephone companies concerned to allow or agree upon such physical connection or connections, or the terms and conditions upon which the same shall be made, application may be made to the commission for an order requiring such connection and fixing the compensation, terms and conditions thereof, and if after investigation and hearing the commission shall find that such physical connections will not result in irreparable injury to such telephone properties, the commission shall by order direct that such connections be made, and prescribe reasonable conditions and compensation therefor and for the joint use thereof, and by whom the expense of making and maintaining such connection or connections shall be paid. When application is made requesting physical connection it shall be presumed that such connection is necessary, and that the public convenience will be promoted thereby, and the burden of overcoming such presumption shall be upon the party resisting such application. The telephone companies so connecting shall give service over the connecting line or lines without preference to or discrimination against any service or telephone company whatever.\nWherever a physical connection or connections exist between any telephone exchange system operated by a telephone company and the toll line or lines operated by another telephone company or between its toll line or lines and the telephone exchange system of another telephone company, or between its toll line and the toll line of another telephone company, neither of the companies shall cause such connection to be severed or the service between the companies to be discontinued without first obtaining an order from the commission upon an application for permission to discontinue such physical connection. Upon the filing of an application for discontinuance of such a connection, the department shall investigate and ascertain whether public convenience requires the continuance of such physical connection, and if the department so finds, the commission shall fix the compensation, terms and conditions of the continuance of the physical connection and service between the telephone companies.\nTelephone companies providing long-distance telephone services shall pay compensation to telephone companies providing local telephone services that includes a fair and reasonable portion of:\n(1) the costs of local exchange facilities used in connection with long-distance telephone services, including facilities connecting a customer to local switching facilities; and\n(2) the common costs of companies providing local telephone services.\nFor telephone companies with more than 50,000 access lines, the prices for interconnection or network elements to be established by the commission in any pending or future proceeding shall be based on a forward-looking economic cost methodology which shall include, but is not limited to, consideration of the following:\n(1) the use of the most efficient telecommunications technology currently available and the least cost network configuration, given the existing location of the incumbent telephone company's wire centers;\n(2) forward-looking depreciation rates;\n(3) a reasonable allocation of forward-looking joint and common costs;\n(4) forward-looking cost of capital; and\n(5) Minnesota tax rates, and where applicable, Minnesota facility placement requirements, Minnesota topography, and Minnesota climate.",
