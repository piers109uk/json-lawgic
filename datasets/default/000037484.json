	"text": "An owner of a mark registered under sections 333.18 to 333.31 may bring an action to enjoin the manufacture, use, display, or sale of any counterfeits or imitations of the mark, and a court of competent jurisdiction may grant injunctions to restrain the manufacture, use, display, or sale as the court considers just and reasonable. The court may require the defendants to pay to the owner either or both of the following: (1) all profits derived from the wrongful manufacture, use, display, or sale; or (2) all damages suffered by reason of the wrongful manufacture, use, display, or sale. The court may also order that counterfeits or imitations in the possession or under the control of a defendant be delivered to an officer of the court, or to the complainant, to be destroyed. The court, in its discretion, may enter judgment for an amount not to exceed three times the profits and damages and reasonable attorneys' fees of the prevailing party if the court finds the other party committed the wrongful acts with knowledge or in bad faith or otherwise as according to the circumstances of the case.\nThe enumeration of any right or remedy herein shall not affect a registrant's right to prosecute under any penal law of this state.",
