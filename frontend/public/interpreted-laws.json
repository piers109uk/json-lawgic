If the licensee is not able to do so, the commissioner may draw on the letter of credit in an amount up to the amount necessary to meet the licensee's requirements to maintain permissible investments in accordance with section 53B.61, paragraph (a). Any draw under this paragraph must be offset against the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations. The drawn funds must be held in trust by the commissioner or the commissioner's designated agent, to the extent authorized by law, as agent for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations.\n(c) The letter of credit must provide that the issuer of the letter of credit must honor, at sight, a presentation made by the beneficiary to the issuer of the following documents on or before the expiration date of the letter of credit:\n(1) the original letter of credit, including any amendments; and\n(2) a written statement from the beneficiary stating that any of the following events have occurred:\n(i) the filing of a petition by or against the licensee under the United States Bankruptcy Code, United States Code, title 11, sections 101 to 110, as amended or recodified from time to time, for bankruptcy or reorganization;\n(ii) the filing of a petition by or against the licensee for receivership, or the commencement of any other judicial or administrative proceeding for the licensee's dissolution or reorganization;\n(iii) the seizure of assets of a licensee by a commissioner of any other state pursuant to an emergency order issued in accordance with applicable law, on the basis of an action, violation, or condition that has caused or is likely to cause the insolvency of the licensee; or\n(iv) the beneficiary has received notice of expiration or nonextension of a letter of credit and the licensee failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the beneficiary that the licensee will maintain permissible investments in accordance with section 53B.61, paragraph (a), upon the expiration or nonextension of the letter of credit.\n(d) The commissioner may designate an agent to serve on the commissioner's behalf as beneficiary to a letter of credit, provided the agent and letter of credit meet requirements the commissioner establishes. The commissioner's agent may serve as agent for multiple licensing authorities for a single irrevocable letter of credit if the proceeds of the drawable amount for the purposes of subdivision 1, clause (4), and this subdivision are assigned to the commissioner.\n(e) The commissioner is authorized to participate in multistate processes designed to facilitate the issuance and administration of letters of credit, including but not limited to services provided by the NMLS and State Regulatory Registry, LLC.\nUnless the commissioner by administrative rule or order otherwise permits an investment to exceed the limit set forth in this subdivision, the following investments are permissible under section 53B.61 to the extent specified:\n(1) receivables that are payable to a licensee from its authorized delegates in the ordinary course of business that are less than seven days old, up to 50 percent of the aggregate value of the licensee's total permissible investments;\n(2) of the receivables permissible under clause (1), receivables that are payable to a licensee from a single authorized delegate in the ordinary course of business may not exceed ten percent of the aggregate value of the licensee's total permissible investments;\n(3) the following investments are permissible up to 20 percent per category and combined up to 50 percent of the aggregate value of the licensee's total permissible investments:\n(i) a short-term investment of up to six months bearing an eligible rating;\n(ii) commercial paper bearing an eligible rating;\n(iii) a bill, note, bond, or debenture bearing an eligible rating;\n(iv) United States tri-party repurchase agreements collateralized at 100 percent or more with United States government or agency securities, municipal bonds, or other securities bearing an eligible rating;\n(v) money market mutual funds rated less than \"AAA\" and equal to or higher than \"A-\" by S&P, or the equivalent from any other eligible rating service; and\n(vi) a mutual fund or other investment fund composed solely and exclusively of one or more permissible investments listed in subdivision 1, clauses (1) to (3); and\n(4) cash, including demand deposits, savings deposits, and funds in accounts held for the benefit of the licensee's customers, at foreign depository institutions are permissible up to ten percent of the aggregate value of the licensee's total permissible investments, if the licensee has received a satisfactory rating in the licensee's most recent examination and the foreign depository institution:\n(i) has an eligible rating;\n(ii) is registered under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, Public Law 111-147;\n(iii) is not located in any country subject to sanctions from the Office of Foreign Asset Control; and\n(iv) is not located in a high-risk or noncooperative jurisdiction, as designated by the Financial Action Task Force.",

    "text": "Pursuant to applicable federal and state law under which Minnesota was admitted to the union on equal footing with the original 13 states, navigable waters and their beds located within the exterior boundaries of the state are owned by the state. In a few limited circumstances, as in section 1.044, relating to the Upper Mississippi Wildlife and Fish Refuge, the state has expressly granted its consent and concurrent jurisdiction to the United States to acquire interests in water, as well as land, for a limited purpose and in the limited area described in its consent. Unlike section 1.044, the consent granted by the state in section 1.045 to acquisitions by the United States for the Superior National Forest is limited to land, only. The state has never ceded to the United States, either expressly or implicitly, its ownership of and jurisdiction over the navigable waters and their beds that are located within the exterior boundaries of the forest.\nPursuant to the Organic Act that created the territory of Minnesota (Act of Congress, March 3, 1849, 9 Stat. ch. 121, section 18), and the Enabling Act that authorized the people of the territory of Minnesota to establish the state of Minnesota (Act of Congress, February 26, 1857, 11 Stat. ch. 60, section 5, first paragraph), federal public domain lands located in sections 16 and 36 in every township at the time of statehood were granted to the state for the use of schools, together with equivalent land located in other sections if section 16 or 36 had been disposed of before statehood. In conformity with the terms of the federal grant, the citizens of Minnesota, by constitution, article XI, section 8, have dedicated the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of these school grant lands, and the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of lands subsequently received from the United States under swampland grants, to public school purposes. By constitution, article XI, sections 8 and 10, the disposition of school and swampland grant lands, frequently referred to as trust fund lands, is limited to sale at public auction or exchange. Roughly 100,000 acres of state-owned, mostly trust fund land, is located within that portion of the Superior National Forest that is described as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Much of this state-owned trust fund land, as well as other state-owned land that is tax-forfeited and is held in trust for local taxing districts, is high-value lakeshore land. The state has not disposed of these lands to the United States and has not ceded jurisdiction over these lands, either expressly or implicitly, to the United States.\nIn the discharge of their official duties, the governor, attorney general, other constitutional officers, and other public officials, such as the commissioner of natural resources, shall vigorously assert and defend, in all forums, the state's ownership of and jurisdiction over the navigable waters and their beds, the state trust fund lands and lands held in trust for local taxing districts located in the Superior National Forest, the natural resources related to these lands, waters, and beds, and the associated rights of the state and its citizens arising from the state's ownership and jurisdictional interests in these lands, waters, and beds. In furtherance of their duties, the governor, attorney general, other constitutional officers, and other public officials shall, additionally, be especially cognizant of the free rights of travel afforded to citizens of Minnesota and others under the Webster-Ashburton Treaty (proclaimed November 10, 1842) and the Root-Bryce Treaty (proclaimed May 13, 1910) on international and associated boundary waters. Also, in furtherance of their duties, in any exchange or other disposition of state-owned land located within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the governor, attorney general, state auditor, commissioner of natural resources, and any other public official involved in such matters shall be especially cognizant of the high value of the lakeshore and other state land located within the area.",

The will must be personally delivered or sent by registered mail. If the interested person so requests, any deed to burial lot or document containing instructions for the burial of the lessee may be copied by the safe deposit box company and the copy or copies thereof delivered to the interested person.\n(g) If the box is opened for the purpose of obtaining a document required to facilitate the lessee's wishes regarding the body, funeral, or burial arrangements, any such document may be removed from the box and delivered to the interested person with a true and correct machine copy retained in the box. If the safe deposit box company discovers a document that appears to be a will, the safe deposit company shall act in accordance with paragraph (f).\n(h) If the box is opened for the purpose of obtaining an inventory of the contents of the box, the employee of the safe deposit company shall make, or cause to be made, an inventory of the contents of the box, to which the employee and the interested person shall attest under penalty of perjury to be correct and complete. Within ten days of opening the box pursuant to this subdivision, the safe deposit company shall deliver the original inventory of the contents to the court administrator for the county in which the lessee resided immediately before the lessee's death, if known to the safe deposit company, otherwise to the court administrator for the county in which the safe deposit box is located. The inventory must be personally delivered or sent by registered mail. If the interested person so requests, the safe deposit company shall make a true and correct copy of any document in the box, and of the completed inventory form, and deliver that copy to the interested person. If the contents of the box include a document that appears to be a will, the safe deposit company shall act in accordance with paragraph (f).\n(i) If a box opened for the purpose of conducting an inventory, will search, or burial document search is completely empty, the safe deposit company need not follow the procedures above. Instead, the employee of the safe deposit company can complete an inventory of the box contents indicating the fact that the box contained nothing. The form must be signed by the employee and the interested person. If the interested person so requests, the safe deposit company may provide a copy of the completed inventory form to the interested person. The interested person shall then complete the documentation needed by the safe deposit company to surrender the empty box. If another interested person inquires about the box after it has been surrendered, the safe deposit company may state that the deceased renter had previously rented the box and that the box was surrendered because it was empty.\n(j) The safe deposit company need not ascertain the truth of any statement in the affidavit required to be furnished under this subdivision and when acting in reliance upon an affidavit, it is discharged as if it dealt with the personal representative of the lessee. The safe deposit company is not responsible for the adequacy of the description of any property included in an inventory of the contents of a safe deposit box, nor for conversion of the property in connection with actions performed under this subdivision, except for conversion by intentional acts of the company or its employees, directors, officers, or agents. If the safe deposit company is not satisfied that the requirements of this subdivision have been met, it may decline to open the box.\n(k) No contents of a box other than a will and a document required to facilitate the lessee's wishes regarding body, funeral, or burial arrangements may be removed pursuant to this subdivision. The entire contents of the box, however, may be removed pursuant to section 524.3-1201.",

The emergency temporary location, or locations, shall remain the seat of government until the legislature by law establishes a new location, or locations, or until the emergency is declared to be ended by the governor and the seat of government is returned to its normal location.\nWhile the seat of government remains at an emergency temporary location, or locations, all official acts required by law to be performed at the seat of government by any officer, agency, department or authority of this state, including the convening and meeting of the legislature in regular, extraordinary, or emergency session, shall be as valid and binding when performed at the emergency temporary location, or locations, as if performed at the normal location of the seat of government.\nWhen, due to an emergency resulting from the effects of enemy attack, or the anticipated effects of a threatened enemy attack, it becomes imprudent, inexpedient or impossible to conduct the affairs of local government at their regular or usual place or places, the governing body of each political subdivision of this state may meet at any place in or out of the territorial limits of the political subdivision on the call of the presiding officer or any two members of the governing body, and shall designate by ordinance, resolution or other manner, alternate or substitute places as the emergency temporary location, or locations, of government where all, or any part, of the public business may be conducted during the emergency situation. The places may be in or out of the territorial limits of the political subdivision and the state.\nWhile the public business is being conducted at the emergency temporary location, or locations, the governing body and other officers of a political subdivision shall exercise, at the location, or locations, all of the executive, legislative, and judicial powers and functions conferred upon it and its officers by its charter and the laws and constitution of this state. Acts of the governing body and officers shall be as valid and binding as if performed within the territorial limits of their political subdivision.\nThis section shall be supreme if it is employed notwithstanding any other statute, charter or ordinance.",

    "text": "(a) A licensee must maintain at all times permissible investments that have a market value computed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles of not less than the aggregate amount of all of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations.\n(b) Except for permissible investments enumerated in section 53B.62, paragraph (a), the commissioner may by administrative rule or order, with respect to any licensee, limit the extent to which a specific investment maintained by a licensee within a class of permissible investments may be considered a permissible investment, if the specific investment represents undue risk to customers not reflected in the market value of investments.\n(c) Permissible investments, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, are held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations in the event of insolvency; the filing of a petition by or against the licensee under the United States Bankruptcy Code, United States Code, title 11, sections 101 to 110, as amended or recodified from time to time, for bankruptcy or reorganization; the filing of a petition by or against the licensee for receivership; the commencement of any other judicial or administrative proceeding for the licensee's dissolution or reorganization; or in the event of an action by a creditor against the licensee who is not a beneficiary of this statutory trust. No permissible investments impressed with a trust pursuant to this paragraph are subject to attachment, levy of execution, or sequestration by order of any court, except for a beneficiary of the statutory trust.\n(d) Upon the establishment of a statutory trust in accordance with paragraph (c), or when any funds are drawn on a letter of credit pursuant to section 53B.62, paragraph (a), clause (4), the commissioner must notify the applicable regulator of each state in which the licensee is licensed to engage in money transmission, if any, of the establishment of the trust or the funds drawn on the letter of credit, as applicable. Notice is deemed satisfied if performed pursuant to a multistate agreement or through NMLS. Funds drawn on a letter of credit, and any other permissible investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations, are deemed held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations on a pro rata and equitable basis in accordance with statutes pursuant to which permissible investments are required to be held in Minnesota and other states, as defined by a substantially similar statute in the other state. Any statutory trust established under this section terminates upon extinguishment of all of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations.\n(e) The commissioner may by rule or by order allow other types of investments that the commissioner determines are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment. The commissioner is authorized to participate in efforts with other state regulators to determine that other types of investments are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment.",

    "title": "611A.203 DOMESTIC FATALITY REVIEW TEAMS.",
    "text": "A judicial district may establish a domestic fatality review team to review domestic violence deaths that have occurred in the district. The team may review cases in which prosecution has been completed or the prosecutorial authority has decided not to pursue the case. The purpose of the review team is to assess domestic violence deaths in order to develop recommendations for policies and protocols for community prevention and intervention initiatives to reduce and eliminate the incidence of domestic violence and resulting fatalities.\n\"Domestic violence death\" means a homicide or suicide under any of the following circumstances:\n(1) the alleged perpetrator and victim resided together at any time;\n(2) the alleged perpetrator and victim have a child in common, regardless of whether they were married or lived together at any time;\n(3) the alleged perpetrator and victim were married, separated, or divorced;\n(4) the alleged perpetrator and victim had a sexual relationship or a significant romantic relationship;\n(5) the alleged perpetrator had been harassing or stalking the victim;\n(6) the homicide victim lived in the same household, was present in the workplace of, was in proximity of, or was related by blood or affinity to a victim who experienced or was threatened with domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator;\n(7) the victim or the perpetrator was a child of a person in a relationship that is described within this definition; or\n(8) any other circumstances that the domestic fatality review team decides fall within the parameters of its mission.\n\"Domestic violence death\" must be interpreted broadly to give the domestic fatality review team discretion to review fatalities that have occurred both directly and peripherally to domestic relationships.\n(a) The chief judge, in consultation with the family violence coordinating council, shall appoint the members of the domestic fatality review team. Membership must reflect a commitment to diversity and relevant professional experience. The review team members must include:\n(1) the medical examiner;\n(2) a judicial court officer (judge or referee);\n(3) a county and city attorney and a public defender;\n(4) the county sheriff and a peace officer;\n(5) a representative from family court services and the Department of Corrections;\n(6) a physician familiar with domestic violence issues;\n(7) a representative from district court administration and the domestic abuse service center;\n(8) a public citizen representative or a representative from a civic organization;\n(9) a mental health professional; and\n(10) domestic violence advocates or shelter workers.\n(b) There must be at least three domestic violence advocates or shelter workers on the domestic fatality review team. No two members may represent the same agency. Members representing advocates or shelters must be selected by the advocacy community. At least one position must be designated for a minority representative and one position must rotate in order to include an advocate from the community in which the fatality under review took place.\n(c) The domestic fatality review team may also invite other relevant persons to serve on an ad hoc basis and participate as full members of the review team for a particular review. These persons may include, but are not limited to:\n(1) individuals with particular expertise that would be helpful to the review panel; or\n(2) representatives of organizations or agencies that had contact with or provided services to the homicide victim, or to the alleged perpetrator, a victim who experienced or was threatened with domestic abuse by the alleged perpetrator, or a family member of one of those individuals.\n(a) The domestic fatality review team shall collect, review, and analyze death certificates and death data, including investigative reports, medical and counseling records, victim service records, employment records, child abuse reports, or other information concerning domestic violence deaths, survivor interviews and surveys, and other information deemed by the team as necessary and appropriate concerning the causes and manner of domestic violence deaths.\n(b) The review team has access to the following not public data, as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 8a, relating to a case being reviewed by the team: inactive law enforcement investigative data under section 13.82; autopsy records and coroner or medical examiner investigative data under section 13.83; hospital, public health, or other medical records of the victim under section 13.384; records under section 13.46, created by social service agencies that provided services to the victim, the alleged perpetrator, or another victim who experienced or was threatened with domestic abuse by the perpetrator; and child maltreatment records under chapter 260E, relating to the victim or a family or household member of the victim. Access to medical records under this paragraph also includes records governed by sections 144.291 to 144.298. The review team has access to corrections and detention data as provided in section 13.85.\n(c) As part of any review, the domestic fatality review team may compel the production of other records by applying to the district court for a subpoena, which will be effective throughout the state according to the Rules of Civil Procedure.\nA person attending a domestic fatality review team meeting may not disclose what transpired at the meeting, except to carry out the purposes of the review team or as otherwise provided in this subdivision. The review team may disclose the names of the victims in the cases it reviewed. The proceedings and records of the review team are confidential data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 3, or protected nonpublic data as defined in section 13.02, subdivision 13, regardless of their classification in the hands of the person who provided the data, and are not subject to discovery or introduction into evidence in a civil or criminal action against a professional, the state, or a county agency, arising out of the matters the team is reviewing. Information, documents, and records otherwise available from other sources are not immune from discovery or use in a civil or criminal action solely because they were presented during proceedings of the review team. This section does not limit a person who presented information before the review team or who is a member of the panel from testifying about matters within the person's knowledge. However, in a civil or criminal proceeding, a person may not be questioned about the person's good faith presentation of information to the review team or opinions formed by the person as a result of the review team meetings.\nMembers of the domestic fatality advisory board, members of the domestic fatality review team, and members of each review panel, as well as their agents or employees, are immune from claims and are not subject to any suits, liability, damages, or any other recourse, civil or criminal, arising from any act, proceeding, decision, or determination undertaken or performed or recommendation made by the domestic fatality review team, provided they acted in good faith and without malice in carrying out their responsibilities. Good faith is presumed until proven otherwise and the complainant has the burden of proving malice or a lack of good faith. No organization, institution, or person furnishing information, data, testimony, reports, or records to the domestic fatality review team as part of an investigation is civilly or criminally liable or subject to any other recourse for providing the information.\n(a) Each domestic fatality review team shall develop a system for evaluating the effectiveness of its program and shall focus on identifiable goals and outcomes. An evaluation must include data components as well as input from individuals involved in the review process.\n(b) Each fatality review team shall issue an annual report to the chairs and ranking minority members of the senate and house of representatives committees with jurisdiction over public safety issues. The report must consist of the written aggregate recommendations of the domestic fatality review team without reference to specific cases. The report must be available upon request and distributed to the governor, attorney general, supreme court, county board, and district court.",

The record must contain:\n(1) the name and contact information of the licensee, including information the person may need to ask a question or file a complaint;\n(2) the type, value, date, precise time, and amount of the transaction; and\n(3) the fee charged for the transaction, including any charge for conversion of virtual currency to money, bank credit, or other virtual currency.\n(d) If a licensee discloses that it provides a daily confirmation in the initial disclosure under paragraph (c), the licensee may elect to provide a single, daily confirmation for all transactions with or on behalf of a person on that day instead of a per-transaction confirmation.",

If the commissioner shall not so find, the commissioner shall not issue a license and shall notify the applicant of the denial and return to the applicant the sum paid by the applicant as a license fee, retaining the $500 investigation fee to cover the costs of investigating the application. The commissioner shall approve or deny every application for license hereunder within 60 days from the filing thereof with the fees.\nIf the application is denied, the commissioner shall, within 20 days thereafter, file in the commissioner's office a written decision and findings with respect thereto containing the evidence and the reasons supporting the denial, and forthwith serve upon the applicant a copy thereof.\nThere is hereby appropriated to such persons as are entitled to such refund, from the fund or account in the state treasury to which the money was credited, an amount sufficient to make the refund and payment.",

The disclosures must include at least the following information:\n(1) virtual currency is not legal tender, backed or insured by the government, and accounts and value balances are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections;\n(2) some virtual currency transactions are deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which may not be the date or time when the person initiates the transaction;\n(3) virtual currency's value may be derived from market participants' continued willingness to exchange fiat currency for virtual currency, which may result in the permanent and total loss of a particular virtual currency's value if the market for virtual currency disappears;\n(4) a person who accepts a virtual currency as payment today is not required to accept and might not accept virtual currency in the future;\n(5) the volatility and unpredictability of the price of virtual currency relative to fiat currency may result in a significant loss over a short period;\n(6) the nature of virtual currency means that any technological difficulties experienced by virtual currency kiosk operators may prevent access to or use of a person's virtual currency; and\n(7) any bond maintained by the virtual currency kiosk operator for the benefit of a person may not cover all losses a person incurs.\n(b) The virtual currency kiosk operator must provide an additional disclosure, which must be acknowledged by the person, written prominently and in bold type, and provided separately from the disclosures above, stating: \"WARNING: LOSSES DUE TO FRAUDULENT OR ACCIDENTAL TRANSACTIONS ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND TRANSACTIONS IN VIRTUAL CURRENCY ARE IRREVERSIBLE. VIRTUAL CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS MAY BE USED BY SCAMMERS IMPERSONATING LOVED ONES, THREATENING JAIL TIME, AND INSISTING YOU WITHDRAW MONEY FROM YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TO PURCHASE VIRTUAL CURRENCY.\"\n(a) A virtual currency kiosk operator must disclose all relevant terms and conditions generally associated with the products, services, and activities of the virtual currency kiosk operator and virtual currency. A virtual currency kiosk operator must make the disclosures in a clear, conspicuous, and easily readable manner.

The disclosures under this subdivision must address at least the following:\n(1) the amount of the transaction;\n(2) any fees, expenses, and charges, including applicable exchange rates;\n(3) the type and nature of the transaction;\n(4) a warning that once completed, the transaction may not be reversed;\n(5) a daily virtual currency transaction limit of no more than $2,000;\n(6) the difference in the virtual currency's sale price compared to the current market price; and\n(7) other disclosures that are customarily given in connection with a virtual currency transaction.\nBefore completing a transaction, a virtual currency kiosk operator must ensure that each person who engages in a virtual currency transaction using the virtual currency operator's kiosk acknowledges receipt of all disclosures required under this section via confirmation of consent. Additionally, upon a transaction's completion, the virtual currency kiosk operator must provide a person with a physical receipt, or a virtual receipt sent to the person's email address or SMS number, containing the following information:\n(1) the virtual currency kiosk operator's name and contact information, including a telephone number to answer questions and register complaints;\n(2) the type, value, date, and precise time of the transaction, transaction hash, and each virtual currency address;\n(3) the fees charged;\n(4) the exchange rate;\n(5) a statement of the virtual currency kiosk operator's liability for nondelivery or delayed delivery;\n(6) a statement of the virtual currency kiosk operator's refund policy; and\n(7) any additional information the commissioner of commerce may require.\nA virtual currency kiosk operator must issue a refund to a new customer for the full amount of all transactions made within the 72-hour new customer time period, as described in section 53B.69, subdivision 3b, upon request of the customer. In order to receive a refund under this subdivision, a customer must:\n(1) have been fraudulently induced to engage in the virtual currency transactions; and\n(2) within 14 days of the last transaction to occur during the 72-hour new customer time period, contact the virtual currency kiosk operator and a government or law enforcement agency to inform them of the fraudulent nature of the transaction.\n(a) There is an established maximum daily transaction limit of $2,000 for each new customer of a virtual currency kiosk.\n(b) The maximum daily transaction limit of an existing customer shall be decided by each virtual currency kiosk operator in compliance with federal law.",
